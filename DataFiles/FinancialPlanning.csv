FinancialPlanning,"'Moronic' Monday - Your weekly thread for the questions you've always wanted to ask about personal finances, investing, and growing your personal wealth.",AutoModerator,"Is my financial planner working on my behalf? 

To date, my portfolio increased 4% total over the last four years (since 1/1/2020); not annually, +4% total. I know the market was really up then really down and then up and down during this period of time. 

On a scale of 1-5, 5 being aggressive, the portfolio should be managed at a 4 (moderately aggressive). 

And where can I go to figure out what a good return is over the same period of time? Thx!",Numerous-King-8684

FinancialPlanning,Buying a new home: to sell or to rent out current home?,Jimmy_Mingle,"The high interest savings account will not stay high for very long. 

Your interest rate is very low and even though the market for homes has appreciated, interest rates are high, so it's more expensive for buyers which is holding home prices down somewhat. I would not sell. 

Neting $800, you shoukd be able to cash flow at least a few hundred of that a month unless your house is in a state of disrepair. I'd put $500 aside of that in an account each month to deal with turnover, repairs, etc. 

Over time, rents will increase, while your mortgage will not, so you should continue to net more each year.

FinancialPlanning,Where do I go from here?,Hirsute_Heathen,"Your two main goals is how to stay afloat the next couple months while you try to rebound and at the same time re-evaluate your budget. You likely have a lifestyle problem. It’s truly as simple as money in and money out. Somewhere along the line your expenses outgrew your income. You need to figure it out FAST. 

Have you considered a personal loan? Even for a small amount. Interest rates are high but it’s better than defaulting on your mortgage if you are in such dire straits financially. 

Is your $6000 credit balance on a payment plan? For the next month I would look to just pay the minimum. Possibly consider a personal loan (if your credit isn’t terrible) that will cover 1-2 months of living expenses and the credit card balance. Pay off your credit card balance in full. Set your personal loan to pay off on auto-pay. And any extra money can go to paying down the principal on that loan over the course of the loan term. 

Also.. your wife needs to work. If additional overtime isn’t in the cards for you, she needs to be willing to pick up a job. Could be nights and weekends. Doesn’t have to be permanent. Can be part time. It will affect your and your kids’ home life. But every little bit will help. This isn’t the time for her (and you) to be shy or anxious about what job opportunities are available.

She can get something while the kids are in school, but it either has to be during the hours of 9 to 3 or on the weekends. Unfortunately she has been out of work for 9 years raising our children and taking care of our home (I usually take over when I get home, but she has everything covered). This is something we are discussing now, but it doesn't help us in the immediate.

I don't have anyone to carpool with. I'm the only guy at my shop that lives out of state. As per our union contract mileage is only reimbursed if I move from jobsite to jobsite in the same day or if I travel out of our halls jurisdiction.

I am reaching out to family, but to be honest they aren't in a financial place to help us right now.

We are breaking open the books, since we're in panic mode right now, and reassesing what we can get rid of etc. We don't ever dine out, subs are streaming services, but I intend on getting rid of a few.

As far as a resume goes, I'm out of a union hall and we can't solicit for work so if I quit my shop I have to sit on the bench to be picked up by a different shop and who knows how long that would take and there's no guarantee of where I would get sent too.",Hirsute_Heathen
FinancialPlanning,Where do I go from here?,Hirsute_Heathen,"I appreciate the advice. I agree it's a lifestyle problem. We are scaling back everything as we speak. Our scores right now are in the high 750's last time we checked. The debt is credit card from paying for groceries, gas, clothing etc. So it's something that gets paid down, but is basically always the same. We need to stop that. 

We rarely eat out and if so it's McDonald's or something similar. Either way we need to reel back our spending. I pack lunches for work. The kids lunches are packed as well etc.

I'm looking into side work on the weekends.

I have the max taken out of my check for taxes so usually we make it until tax time and my refund will usually carry us through the year. This is the first time I have ever been broke in my life. It's a wake up call.",Hirsute_Heathen

* Can you move closer to work?
* Could your wife work the lunch shift at a Chic-Fil-A or Arby's? It won't be much but she would at least earn a little (15hrs/week at $15 is like $700 a month after taxes)?
* Can your wife do some kind of from home business. Maybe even involve the kids? It could teach them a good lesson of hard work while helping you stay afloat. 
* I was not implying you should ask family for money. I was seeing if they could pick up the kids once a week to let you and your wife work more hours?
* Do you have any overtime potential?
* Are you able to get a car that is cheaper to operate? Say a Toyota Corolla or a Honda CR-V (if winter weather is an issue)?  No offense, but you strike me as a Big truck type of person. You may need to put your pride aside and buy a vehicle that is better for your situation.

She's also worried not working from home that should something happen to one of our kids, say they get sick or need to leave school for w/e reason we wouldn't have any other way for them to be picked up or looked after.

FinancialPlanning,"Just got my first credit card, how should I use it?",Thermobyte,">I've heard from some sources that you should carry at least a small balance month-to-month if you want to build credit.

Very bluntly, those sources are idiots. 

You build credit by keeping the account open, and establishing a long history of on-time payments, not by carrying a balance. All carrying a balance does for you is accrue interest.

You want your utilization as low as possible - and the lowest possible utilization is 0% (which is what you get when you pay off the entire balance every month). Thus, it's best to have a card with no annual fee and good rewards. The low interest rate is good, but meaningless if you pay off the full balance every month like you should.",glumpoodle

The greatest impact is missing a payment followed by high utilization, carrying a balance month to month has only a bad impact as it means your utilization is higher. If you actually want better credit you want to pay off your balance early so that it gets reported as a zero balance and then your score is calculated with 0% utilization which maximizes your score.",NeighborhoodDog
FinancialPlanning,"Just got my first credit card, how should I use it?",Thermobyte,"Really happy with the responses here. 
Never carry a balance. Always pay off the amount due every month. Charge something small, pay if off when due. 

For those who try to shy away from credit cards, I'd you can use them appropriately, they are the fastest way to build credit. 

Also, if your credit union offers a reserve line of credit, apply for one. Then never use it. That also builds credit fast and costs you nothing.

I agree with other comments saying to auto pay the full statement amount on time. Rolling over your balance and getting charged interest does not speed up the process. Keeping your utilization (under 10%) low does help.

An additional suggestion, before you lock in your auto financing, shop around a little. Credit unions are great, but they don't always have the best rates. Especially if you're going to a dealership - they have 4-6% right now and I've seen a few special offers of 0% first year.",Old_Map6556

It is the interest that prevents you from paying down that debt, so, never, and I mean NEVER carry anything forward if you can help it. With a good credit score if you need money for some emergency purchase you can hit up the bank for terms that are much more favorable to you.

Honestly, you have a good idea of what you should do. You have just not done what you know is right. You need to separate business expenses! Otherwise any type of audit will be a nightmare! Here are some best practices:

* Separate business bank account.
* Separate business DEBIT CARD. It seems like you are not a credit card person
* Have a CPA help you with monthly/semiweekly payroll checks. They may be able to help with the 401k as well. 
* Don't use the company as a cookie jar. That is lazy. Transfer money you need from the business account .
* Remember to record mileage, food, office supplies, and anything else. This is made easier by separating your finances!
* Do you like paying taxes? If not, the IRS basically gives you free money to save for retirement! Take advantage of that! 

For the Financial advisor question I would check out the Money Guy show. They have some good advice on how to go about getting a financial advice. 

The Traditional vs Roth IRA question is a good and overwhelming question. Honestly I use both Roth and traditional IRAs. Both are great. The Roth is more of a long term strategy. The Traditional is more of a short term/tax mitigation strategy. And just because you have one does not mean you can't use both. Just pick the one that suits you today.

We have an SEP IRA which is Traditional so we'll pay taxes on withdrawals but we don't expect our income or withdrawals to be significantly higher so we're ok with this. 

There are plenty of free ways to do payroll or your business bank account may offer services, an accountant/bookkeeper or even a payroll company. I use Corporate Payroll Services and yes even though I could do it myself, I like just submitting my payroll and they send all the quarterly taxes and do my year end info for me.

FinancialPlanning,Seeking Advice on Loan Rate,Witty-Coat3452,"No it’s not a good idea. That rate is terrible.

My recommendations:

1. Open a basic credit card with a low maximum and start putting fixed expenses on it like groceries and gas. Make sure to pay it off to $0 every single month. This will build your credit.

2. Check into what your credit score actually is. If you have ever paid utilities or anything then you have credit it just may not be good. 

3. Try to save for the car and buy it out right.

4. Moving out means new expenses so make sure you start building an emergency fund.

For the car situation I would suggest checking with a credit union, they usually offer lower interest rate.

Then in addition get a credit card that has some sort of cash back like a visa if you shop at Costco or some kind of flyer miles if you have the desire to travel.

FinancialPlanning,What do I need to know about combining finances?,PossiblyAburd,"The tactics behind the merging a counts are minor and easy. There are lots of ways. I do recommend maxing out both your 401ks first, so your take home pay will be closer to 2-1 or every 3-1, than 1.5-1. 

The hard part is the brutally open honesty, and mutual respect. As his income increases faster than yours, make sure neither of you harbor angst or resentment (a relationship killer). Make sure decisions are together and not unilateral. If it ever goes from “we’re in this together” to “but most of the money is mine, so I should get to …” then it’s likely the resentment was growing for years. 

Many couples separate an “allowance”. So maybe each person gets a $500/mo slush fund to do whatever they want. That way you don’t see his minor frivolous spending and get worked up about it, and he doesn’t see yours. I like this idea (although we don’t do it since we’re both so frugal). I see lots of friends complaining about their SO spending $20 for a sandwich or $80 for a bag, and this little hack avoids those petty arguments. 

I don’t want to scare you. Most couples still together never have this happen. Just be aware it is possible - most divorces have a root cause around money - and being proactive can help head it off.

Now to answer the question you really asked. It’s easy to open joint savings and checking, and a joint credit card. Both your pay can go to the checking. If you decided to do the allowance thing, open separate savings accounts but have both your pay go to the checking.

FinancialPlanning,What do I need to know about combining finances?,PossiblyAburd,"There are a few ways to do it:

1.  Fully merge everything.  Both your full paychecks go to one account, all expenses are paid from that one account, etc.

2.  A joint account, with private accounts.  You get paid into your own account, you each contribute to a joint account for joint expenses.  This lets you have your own money and not be judged on everything you buy.  If you go this route, you need to decide if it's a fixed amount you each contribute to joint, or a percentage, and how often you'll be changing it (do bonuses go into joint, etc)

2. Keep pre-marriage bank accounts separate, but add each other as POD beneficiaries. 

3. Inform retirement account admins of your marriage, so they add you to each other’s accounts as beneficiaries. You can keep someone else as your 401(k) beneficiary only if your spouse signs a waiver. 

4. Do NOT cancel separate credit cards or lines of credit, as this will hurt your credit score. You can add each other as authorized users if you plan to use an existing card for household expenses. Or just open a new credit card for this purpose. 

5. I recommend a family spreadsheet (we use Google Docs) where you list all expenses, savings accounts, etc. One spouse is usually more active in terms of managing finances.

FinancialPlanning,What do I need to know about combining finances?,PossiblyAburd,"While I think it’s important to merge “everything”, the most important thing is agreeing on where to set up the main checking account and having your paychecks direct deposited to that account. This may be a new account you setup together, or one of you may like your existing bank more than the other and you start to use that one. If you use an existing account, make sure the other person is added as a joint owner. 

Everything else can happen over time once the main account is established. You may have other bank accounts that you want to consolidate but there’s not a huge rush to do so. I’d also encourage moving to a single credit card with some sort of rewards and using that for your spending as long as you pay it off regularly. Over time you will likely want to set up a brokerage account for any non-401k investments (IRAs or non-tax advantaged investments).

FinancialPlanning,Should I pay off my car or try to trade it in? And related advice requested!,kabuto_mushi,">Do a comparison of what you’re spending annually for maintenance and fuel.

I can do that, I think. So, just looking at the next year of time:

Plan A: Repair and Keep the Subaru 

- Repair cost: $2k minimum up front. Because the mechanic I took it to was originally supposed to be exchanging the head gaskets (already a pricey job), and he decided it wasn't worth it due to the wheel barings, I pretty much know it'll be more than that. But I'll say $2.5k to make it continue to be drivable. 

- $2.5k to finishing paying it off. I can do it in smaller payments but since I have the cash I might as well do it faster to avoid more in interest? 

- Gas: I drive 50mi to work round trip, on a 7-on-7-off schedule. Every two weeks I'm filling up twice for about $60. So that's 60 x 2 x 2 x 12 = $2880 for fuel. 

- Oil: It burns through oil much faster than a normal car. It needs a full oil replacement about every 2.5 months, and the price varies depending on if I have the time and place to do it myself. Let's say I get it done for $100 every 3 months, so 400 for the year. 

That means estimated total for the next year for this plan is $8,280. Of course, that doesn't cover anything else going wrong or even driving it places that aren't directly to work (which is obviously very silly).

Plan B: Buy newer Prius, ditch Subaru

- Cost of car: I'm seeing many 2021/22 Prius in the 21-23k range. Because I know there will likely be registration fees and such, as well as interest, I'm going to estimate the total cost at 25k? Let's assume that a.) I'm able to break even on the subaru, either selling it to a dealership or a private party. (If I can get more than even 2.5k, I'll have come out ahead of this number). And b.) I can muster a $5k down payment. That means the debt will be about 20k. Again, assuming what Google says is the average car loan period of 72 months, that brings the monthly car payment to around $277, or 3,333 per year. Keep in mind i had been paying 300 with relatively little sweat, so this feels doable to me. 

- Gas: My coworkers who drive similar distances and have Prius say they fill up once per our work week and the gas tank is about half as big as in the subaru. In other words, 30 x 2 x 12 = 720 in gas yearly

- Maintenence: Google says you can expect to spend on average 400 per year in routine maintenance. 

Yearly cost for this plan: $4,453. So, we're beating plan A by about half. Does this look about right? The only thing I can think that I haven't factored in is that my insurance might change a bit, I'm paying about 130/mo with Geico right now. 

For years beyond this one... I would estimate Plan A to cost slightly less? Gas and oil would be the same, but I wouldn't have a car payment. Maintenence (considering what I've been through with it thus far) I'd probably double to 800. That puts me at 4080... which is just slightly less that the Prius. 

Unless I'm missing something, the choice looks pretty clear to me....",kabuto_mushi
FinancialPlanning,Should I pay off my car or try to trade it in? And related advice requested!,kabuto_mushi,"Yeah... I WAS really looking forward to not having to make a car payment every month. It sucks that it couldn't even last that long. The issue is its going to cost AT LEAST $2k up front to keep it rolling, likely more, and SOON. And that is from a reliable mechanic (a garage a family member works, so I know they are reliable). They straight up told me ""it's not worth it"". Hence why I came up with the ""find something new"" plan.

I could go with something I CAN afford in cash, like a 3k clunker off FBM. But I'd assuredly be back in this situation again in a year.",kabuto_mushi

Agree with you, 3k is still a really conservative estimate unless there's obvious cosmetic or driving flaws. There was major demand and price gauging for vehicles around the time OP bought. Prices have stabilized and maybe come down that much.

I'm hoping to get around 3-4k for a 2010 Corolla as a trade in next month.

Edit spelling error",Old_Map6556
FinancialPlanning,Should I pay off my car or try to trade it in? And related advice requested!,kabuto_mushi,"So it looks like it’s a close comparison to me. I would consider buying a jug or two of oil to keep in the trunk, and check every time you get gas to top off as needed. Then change your oil only at regularly scheduled intervals (I change all my vehicles at 5,000 even if they say I can do more). 

I would still keep it for another year or two until you are spending more than it would cost for a new car. Now if you’re having constant engine trouble that’s a different story, or it’s become so unreliable that you aren’t able to get to where you need to get. 

Mathematically, I’d keep the forester for another few years, pay it off, and keep paying the car payment to yourself into a HYSA. If you keep paying $300 a month you’ll have $7,200 after 2 years. Your Subaru won’t be worth significantly less as it’s already mostly depreciated, and you might be able to buy a close to $10,000 vehicle cash that’s going to be much more reliable than your current vehicle.

I believe that for inherited IRAs, the process is that the account has to be transferred to you first and reclassified as an inherited IRA.  Then you can take distributions or roll it over into another account of the same kind at another brokerage.

My 2 cents: Life is too short not to live in a house you want to live in or to be worrying about constantly fixing things.

Consider selling both and buying 1 for cash. With no mortgage payments you will be saving lots of money, far more than $300 a month. You can use these savings to invest in the market or a few years from now you can have enough to buy another rental home. 

If you are concerned about doing what is best financially. Put together an Excel spreadsheet noting your two options. 
1.  Being your current situation with the income from the rental homes plus the expected gain from the homes' value, minus maintenance costs of the homes.
2.  Being buying 1 for cash with the amount you will be saving on mortgage payments as an income, plus the expected gain from the one home's value. Don't forget to add whatever percentage of returns for the investments you make.",n_o_t_d_o_g

* Interest rates may rise but could also drop in a few years. Hard to predict long-term rates.  

* Rental income cushions the mortgage, but comes with overhead costs too. Is the net profit worth managing it?  

* Could you cash-out refinance the rental to pay for renovations rather than selling? Depends on equity.  

* Keeping the rental gives you flexibility if you move again. Selling loses that asset.  

* Stress of ongoing repairs vs. stress of losing a rental's income - which weighs more?  

* With a baby coming, will you have time/energy to manage the rental properly?  
There's no perfect answer. My suggestion would be to explore a middle ground like refinancing or adjusting the rental strategy to streamline management before selling it.

This number includes single-family residents, condos, apartments, and mobile homes, both owner-occupied and renter-occupied.  The main reason that housing is currently expensive is that there isn't enough supply to meet the demand. They haven't built enough housing units in the past few decades to keep up with population growth. Simple supply/demand economics. 

Currently the largest population group are the baby boomers, currently 57-7. Over the next 10, 20, 30 years the baby boomers will downsizing homes, selling off second homes, move to nursing homes, and will die. 

Since the population will be decreasing, the demand will be reduced, therefore prices will be reduced. Whether the housing units are corporate-owned or owner-occupied will not matter in how it's related to price. Since demand will be lower, the rent a corporate owner can charge will therefore also be lower, so the value of the housing unit will be lower to the corporate user as well. 

A couple stats to check out:
- the number of housing units by year since the 1970s.
- population by year since the 1970s. 

You will notice that the population has steadily increased since 1970s until now. The the number of housing units also steadily increased since the 1970s, but around 2008 the growth slowed down dramatically and has not picked up again.",n_o_t_d_o_g

Quick google of that suggests there are 142 million housing units in the USA.  Which would mean only 14% of them are owned by investors at all (close to your 15%) but of those then only 18% are businesses which would mean businesses only own 2.5% of the total housing in the USA.  At least in 2018.

That supports your claim that buisness ownership of property is a small percentage of total property in the US.

This is not apples to apples. You'd put a lot more disposable income into a roth vs traditional. Using OP's example he has an additional 3k per year. This is not a small amount.

A Roth really shines when you have a considerable amount in your 401k and want to reduce your tax liability e.g. take 75% from 401k and 25% from roth.

True. I never said otherwise. What I said was

> The whole point of traditional accounts is it allows investing more. ... For OP's case, they could throw that 1.5k into a brokerage account or their 2023 IRA.

It is a fact that investing into a traditional IRA allows for investing more money overall. Not an opinion, a fact.   
Saying ""investing in a traditional IRA allows for investing more overall vs a roth"" is a different from ""investing in a traditional IRA allows investing more into the IRA than a roth IRA.""

If we look at OP's case, they have 13.5k of gross income they want to invest.  

They can invest 12k into a roth IRA and pay the 1.5k in taxes.     
They can invest 12k into a tradtional IRA and put the remaining 1.5k into a taxable brokerage account or put it into their 2023 IRA.   

If you're not happy with the 875k vs 1 mil comparison, a fairer comparison than the 1mil vs 1 mil is:   

> Would you rather have $1,000,000 tax free (roth) or $1,000,000 that you owe taxes on AND $143,000 that is likely tax free?   

$1,143,000 x 87.5% = $1,000,000    
The majority of households pay a 0% LTCG on taxable accounts.  

You're assuming OP would spend that 1.5k. Maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't. They specifically asked for advice. We can advise to invest that 1.5k rather than spend it.   

We should give advice while looking at the whole situation.

Okay, you didn't make an assumption, but you guessed that they would spend the 1.5k in a way that provided $0 value, or at least not in a way you factored in. From your first comment:

> I would venture to guess you won’t even remember what you spent your extra $1500 a year in tax savings on.

We could debate the semantics about an assumption and a guess if you like.
Either way, you simply ignored something worth 140k from your equation, which skews the results. 

> And to be clear. Show me a married couple, retired, $1,000,000 in an IRA, $143,000 in a brokerage, and two SSI checks and I will show you their tax return with cap gains taxed at 15%. Your hypothetical 0% is disingenuous.

You're either drastically overestimating the taxable income in that scenario or drastically underestimating the amount needed to start hitting the 15% LTCG bucket.   

[LTCG is 0% on up to 89k of income](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/long-term-capital-gains-tax/#rates). We also get to add the standard deduction to that, which pushes us to 117k.   
[70% of households do not make enough to pay the 15% LTCG rate](https://dqydj.com/household-income-percentile-calculator/).

Looking at the anecdotal example you brought up:   
[RMD on 1 mil is 38k (rounded up)](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs)  
[Average SSI is $1358/month](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plan-and-ira-required-minimum-distributions-faqs), x 2 people x 12 months = 33k rounded up   
38k from 401k + 33k from SSI = 71k   
We can claim 46k per year in gains and still have 0 LTCG.   

We don't know how much of that brokerage is growth vs contribution. We can go with 100% growth for a high end estimate.   
Using the same RMD math on the taxable, and we're looking at <4k added to income. We're at 75k of income out of the 117k necessary to hit the 15% LTCG. We can increase the 401k, SS, and taxable payments by 50% and still not hit the threshold.

Pros:

1.You force yourself to save

2. Pay off debt quicker

3. Gain a new appreciation for your ""dollar""

Cons:

1. Can lead to depression
2. Creation of a Poverty Mindset
3. May hinder your future investment plans

I've been living well below my means for the past 3 years. Although I've repped benefits. I've become a little obsessive, which has negatively affected a lot of social aspects of my life. It's caused me to put a lot of relationships on the back burner. And has honestly made me really selfish. It's drained me mentally and emotionally, and I find that I'm not finding value in my relationships nor am I placing a reasonable amount of energy towards these relationships.

It's as if I feel like I've become addicted to saving money. It's hard to come out of this mentality/addiction when you've been implementing it into your daily life for years. I'm aware of it now, but it's still hard to overcome and leads to feelings of guilt.

I'm afraid that even when I'm out of debt, I may be fearful of investing into future endeavors whether it be real estate, or investment portfolios.

I guess sometimes balance really does matter, but some situations do require some extremes.

Background of myself: I have $232k in Law School Debt, I just started my career as an Attorney last year. I work 50-60 hrs a week at my day job, I never quit my serving job that I started in college, I now work 10 hrs a week at that job as well. I told myself I would quit the serving job when I became an Attorney. I never did, I've wanted to quit a million times (for my mental health) but I've continuously fought through these feelings because I've been obsessed with making additional cash. It's an extreme burnout, I haven't taken a vacation/trip in a few years. I rarely go out to dinner with friends because I can't justify the spending or time away from my side job. I'm proud of my determination, but not happy with my conscious inability to enjoy life in the moment.

Yes the 401k firm can easily split it into 2 checks, one for all pretax and one for all Roth (including what you converted to Roth). 


>or does it all need to be a ""single"" lump sum rollover?  
You can definitely break up each of the sources. Some plans don’t allow you to do “partial rollovers” such as rollover only the Roth and leave the pretax in the plan. But if you have a new 401k you can easily roll the pretax to the new 401k and the Roth to your Roth IRA.   
>Pending the verdict, would I be given the option to only move the Roth assets and leave the traditional sources intact? The concern was the pro-rata rule with a trad IRA limiting my backdoor Roth contributions.

FinancialPlanning,What to do with a Roth IRA sitting in a CU??,gusming05,">Is it possible to have my CU transfer my Roth IRA to a brokerage like Vanguard? Or do I need to start over?

Yes, you can rollover this IRA's balance into an IRA at any other institution.  Personally, I've had better luck initiating things at the receiving side.  So you'd open a new Roth IRA with Vanguard, I think during that it'll ask if you are going to want to rollover money into it.  You'd say ""yes"", and then go through the process of identifying that other IRA (bank, account number, balance) and they handle most of the work from there.

>Is it worth asking my CU if they can do anything with the funds in my Roth IRA now?

And IRA is somewhat like a ""wrapper"" around an inner financial account.  That account can only be whatever the institution can offer in general.  Banks do not (and IIRC by law cannot) offer accounts allowing general investing.  At best you can buy CDs, but unless you were already in retirement and wanted to be extremely conservative, that's not going to be much help.  You're going to want your money in something that's expected to grow faster than inflation eats away at your dollars' buying power.  

>Starting in January my empolyers offers me a TIAA Savings Plan. My understanding when I opened the Roth was I could roll it into my TIAA account

Roth dollars can only be moved into another Roth account.  And Roth IRA's specifically can only be rolled into another Roth IRA; the IRS [has a chart showing](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf) allowed transfers.

Ive also heard good things about YNAB too.",Bob_The_Brogrammer
FinancialPlanning,How do I get financially stable when I have been living paycheck to paycheck for years.,intrepid_pika716,"Everything starts with a budget. Start by adding up your take-home pay from last month to figure out *exactly* what your monthly income is. That is what you have to work with, and if you've got a steady job, it's not going to change much.

Then add up your rent, car payments, utilities, phone, and student loans. Utilities will vary from month to month, but not by enough to make a difference. These are all fixed expenses that need to be paid every month, and you can predict them to within +/- a few dollars.

Now subtract the two. That's how much wiggle room you have every month, and we haven't even talked about eating yet. If the difference between the two doesn't leave you with enough to eat, then you've got a major problem. You're stuck with student loans, you need electricity, and you can't do anything without a mobile phone these days. That means the only two things that you can fix are your rent, and your car payments - which, are also typically the two biggest expenses in the typical household. If you're already on the edge at this point, you need to move someplace cheaper, pick up roommates, and/or sell the car and buy a clunker.

Last, we get to the variable expenses. If you actually have decent margin between income and your fixed expenses, but are still living paycheck to paycheck, then you've got a spending problem. Start by adding up all your expenses from last month's credit/debit card statement, and put them into categories. Right away, if you see one category coming up over and over again, you should be able to identify a problem.

Finally, also look closely at how much you spent on groceries, versus how much you spent on eating out. You need to eat, but you don't need to eat out; cooking at home is always going to be cheaper, and most people are absolutely shocked when they see how small food expenses build . I certainly was when I was 23; just buying a couple items from the value menu for lunch every other day adds up very quickly.

Ultimately, it comes down to Income - Expenses = Savings/Debt. You can't get away from that cold equation. Financial stability comes from increasing income, reducing expenses or ideally both.

This whole process is uncomfortable, and often painful, for a lot of people. That doesn't matter. You need to do it, because everything starts with a clear assessment of your current situation. You could be better off than you thought, or you could be in the middle of a disaster; you won't know until you look, and you won't be able to fix anything until you know with certainty.",glumpoodle

FinancialPlanning,Drawdown Strategy for House Savings,frunkjuice5,"The issues here are risk and taxes. 

Saving in long term assets, like the stock market, in order to meet short term financial goals ,like a large purchase, is missing the mark. Ideally you want your time horizons and tax planning to align with your goals.  It is like you are running a 200m dash and to train for the race you are running 3 miles a day. You may run much slower when the race comes than you would if you trained by practicing sprinting. And the market is quite volatile. If we were to experience a 40% draw-down and you have to pull your money out on the bottom that would be a very sad day indeed.

Women wear makeup cause it what they are into. 

Does it make them look more attractive?  If done right, yes

Does them being more attractive give them better opportunities, of course, just the way it works.

If men wear makeup, the same result would happen. 

I actually know guys who used to wear makeup, and it did make them look more attractive and made their skin look smoother. 

Also, let say it was something they had to do for interviews. They don't have to wear it when they go to the store or when they go on a date. 

If the person you are trying to attract is only into you cause of a mask you put on, you don't want to date them.

I'm sure some people love it and I don't have a problem with that.  I only wish it weren't a societal expectation put on all women.

FinancialPlanning,How do you plan income based on desired savings?,LimoncelloLady,"> “you need (50k+expenses)*tax rate”

Nope.

Assume X = DESIRED SALARY

- [X * (1-tax rate)] - Expenses = 50,000

Solve for X

For illustration, let’s assume that expenses = $5,000 and tax rate = 12%

- [X * (1-.12)] - 5,000 = 50,000

- [X * .88] - 5,000 = 50,000

- X * .88 = 55,000

- X = 55,000/.88

- X = 62,500

FinancialPlanning,What would you do with $150K in our situation,peepestdeepest,"There's a couple comments with poor advice, so be wary. 

Your wife's student loan debt is daunting, but you should only pay the minimums until it's forgiven. Obviously don't pay extra towards a debt that will be forgiven in 7 years when your monthly is very affordable.

Use your bonus of around $150k to rebuild your emergency fund with enough for 3-6 months worth of expenses. As for the remainder, I agree that putting it towards your ARM is a solid choice. Long term investments could perform slightly better than the 5.9% ""return"" you get from throwing extra at the mortgage principal, but this mortgage needs to be paid off before your rate increases.

Personally, I'd use the bonus cash on increasing your emergency fund and using the remainder towards your ARM. I'd only pay the minimums on both student loans and the auto loan, since your ARM takes priority with a higher rate.",Parking_Fortune9523

So perhaps $100k to the ARM and $50k to HYSA?

Based on that, I don't think you really need a $50k emergency fund. You'll have basically that cash flow in two months. Your stated expenses add up to about $5K a month, but undoubtedly there are other expenses.

I wouldn't pay off the mortgage. You are getting a tax deduction so the net rate is lower. Inflation is making the payment less over time. If rates drop, you can refinance.

I would also pay off the student loans on schedule.

After you have maxed the 401(k)s, just open a brokerage account and buy VTI or VTI and VXUS in a 70/30 ratio (or whatever you feel appropriate). It will grow over time and it's the simplest way to accumulate wealth over time.",Sagelllini

FinancialPlanning,New to brokerage. Am I doing this right?,Annual_Fishing_9883,"Personally, I think the answer depends more on your specific circumstances than the composition of those particular funds. For example:

1. What is your retirement/withdrawal timeline? If this brokerage account is meant to be pulled from in the next 5-10 years, it would probably make sense to lean toward a 60/40 or 70/30 split to somewhat limit the potential equity losses. If the timeline is much longer, it may make more sense to lean toward something more aggressive.

2. What’s the goal for this brokerage account? Is this something you might want access to in the near to mid-term for something like a new car, home remodel, or even as a supplementary emergency fund? The more you want to rely on this money being there, the more conservative you may want to be.

3. What is the current allocation of your pre-tax accounts? Depending on the allocation of your existing accounts, this may be a way to diversify.

As for your actual question, I can completely relate to the set it and forget it mentality. It sounds like this will be a relatively small (for now) piece of your balance sheet, so I personally would not want to spend the time fine-tuning an allocation of funds whose performance will essentially be correlated anyway. The S&P 500 covers a sizable portion of the stock market as it is, and the companies that comprise the S&P 500 have such large international presence that you have some global exposure already. I’m sure there are deeper analyses that can be done, but I think a valid simple approach is to use the S&P 500 as your stock fund, while referring to the thinking points above to choose your allocation between that and bonds.",No_Foundation1407

Generally, there's also mid-cap and small-cap, but what you've got with the top three funds is:

all companies on the US stock markets, twice, plus the 500 biggest companies traded on US stock markets.  That's okay, but know what you're doing.

FZILX gives you some international exposure, and FXNAX gives you exposure to bonds.

AAPL is a stock.  So is Toro.

Since you asked, I generally recommend:

* 40% to FXAIX or another S&P 500 index fund
* 20% to a mid-cap index fund
* 20% to a small-cap index fund (I think FCPGX is one of those)
* 20% to international, like FZILX.

I'm inclined to not invest in bonds.  I'm late 50s and I'm not adding to my bonds exposure.

Some people will say you should have some bonds, and some people will say that my percentage to small-cap is too high, and percentage to international is too small.",micha8st

FinancialPlanning,New to brokerage. Am I doing this right?,Annual_Fishing_9883,"To answer your questions.

1. This account will ideally never needed to be touched even in retirement. We just have very low monthly expense and high income that I want to place some money somewhere else that will make us a better return long term than just a regular savings account. Will we ever touch it? Maybe but definitely not in the next 15-20yrs. 

2. Goal is the same. Just to put away more money instead of foolishly spending it now and to earn better long term returns.

3. Currently, my 401k is in a 2050 TDF which is when I would turn 60. My wife’s is in a 2055 TDF which is when she will be 59. I also have a workplace pension that will pay out 35k a year for life at 51, 40k if I stay to 55, 71k if I work to 60. 

I am just super overwhelmed with all the different stock names, etc as to what I buy in the account. If there was just one to buy that would keep me moderately aggressive, I’d rather do that. I’m not the type to be changing amounts or selling one stock to buy another. Would the Fidelity 500 index fund be a good one stop shop? I know I can also buy TDF in the brokerage. Should I just do that or too much exposure? The funds I listed are just what I read when doing some googling. I have no idea what they are but I can read numbers and they seem like they all do pretty good over the long term.",Annual_Fishing_9883
FinancialPlanning,New to brokerage. Am I doing this right?,Annual_Fishing_9883,"I think the best moderately aggressive single buy option would probably be another TDF. It would definitely put some constraints on both your gains and losses, and generally keep your returns in a somewhat tighter window than going with 100% index funds. The differences between the first three funds you listed are almost none. Researching index funds is a giant rabbit hole and when you start looking at the composition of them, they tend to be almost identical. If you wanted to truly maximize your long-term gains, the easy option is to just pick some sort of low-fee S&P500 or Total Market index fund, like any of the first three on your list, and put 100% toward that. If it would stress you out to check your balance and find it occasionally down 10 or 20%, then a TDF might be a better option. But if I were in your position and this was essentially free money that you aren’t tied to, I’d personally let it ride and go 100% stocks. It just comes down to personal preference and risk tolerance.",No_Foundation1407
FinancialPlanning,New to brokerage. Am I doing this right?,Annual_Fishing_9883,Would it be bad to do a mixture then? Say 80% in the S&P and 20% in a TDF? I can live with some heavy swings but I would hate to be down a bit IF it happened to be a year that we needed some money. I don’t foresee that happening but anything can happen.,Annual_Fishing_9883
FinancialPlanning,New to brokerage. Am I doing this right?,Annual_Fishing_9883,"There’s really no right or wrong answers, it all depends on your goals and your preferences. Even the “right” choices are only right if the market does what you wanted it to. 

I think a mixture could make sense, but I would either do a mixture of an S&P 500 fund and a bond fund, or just a TDF. The reason for that is TDF’s are already a mixture of stocks and bonds, so essentially the mixture you mentioned would be somewhere in the range of 90-95% stocks and 5-10% bonds, so not quite the diversification you’d want. A TDF is just trusting someone at Fidelity to manage the allocation over time and become more conservative (more bonds, less stocks) as you get older. You could also control your own allocation by just setting a percentage split between an index fund and a bond fund.",No_Foundation1407

FinancialPlanning,Is $30K enough of a cushion for family planning?,DukesMum24,"My wife and I had many unpleasant financial surprises with 2 kids.  I’d recommend thinking of it in terms of cashflows and surprise expenses.

It still wasn’t enough, but this is what we did.  We looked at housing, groceries, utilities and monthly necessities and we multiplied by 6 to cover 1/2 year.  We looked at hospital guesstimate for delivery cost and tacked on 20%.  We knew that childcare was expensive later, and that ended up being real sobering.

First child the breastfeeding never took, although with #2 breastfeeding came easy.  Formula is not inexpensive.  Diapers are crazy too.

Outside of that, it is smart to plan in a “what if” spouse is out of work for 8-12 weeks in addition to parental leave.  Hope this helps.",bigblue2011
FinancialPlanning,Is $30K enough of a cushion for family planning?,DukesMum24,"Look into the price of maternal care and labor/delivery for the worst-case financial scenario (emergency cesarian, etc) and then add a 30% buffer for extra hospital stay. Don’t assume your insurance will cover anything other than routine care. Depending on your situation, 30k may not even cover the cost of delivery. (If you’re not American, ignore)",SojiCoppelia
FinancialPlanning,Is $30K enough of a cushion for family planning?,DukesMum24,"So I had a baby 4 months ago so here are some of my suggestions. FWIW, we did do IVF to get pregnant so much of our savings prior to getting pregnant went towards that. 

* Pay off the credit card ASAP, you are losing money by having high interest credit card debit. 
* Instead of worrying about building a large $30k nest egg, instead focus on having a positive cash flow every month that is equivalent to what you estimate the monthly needs of the baby will be. For us that is \~$2,200 (Part-time nanny= $1,300, college savings = $500, and misc \[diapers, wipes, clothes, toys\] $400). Childcare, savings, and other needs aren't going to go away after the first year so building the cash flow (either through cutting expenses or increasing income) will help you maintain stability and sustainability. 
* As soon as I found out I was pregnant we started saving just $500 in a sinking fund every month so we had a little nest egg to buy stuff we needed but didn't get at the baby shower. We probably had $4,000 or so when she was born. 
* Money for health care expenses should be saved in an HSA if you have a qualifying plan. It is a good idea to have your deductible (and OOP max if possible) saved because you will hit it. Also, most hospitals have extended payment plans of 2-3 years and they are interest free. So our medical expenses were about $7,000 (OOP was $7500) and I'm paying the hospital $200/month for 3 years. I technically already have the full amount in my HSA and HYSA, but it's earning almost 5% interest so there is no need to pay the hospital 0% interest bills early. If I ever get tired of seeing the balance, I can pay it off whenever I want.
* If either of you doesn't have paid leave, then saving for that is a good idea. I had 12 weeks paid so I didn't worry about it.
* What we spent before birth: $600, this included a baby class, deposit for newborn photos, maternity photos, and daycare waiting list fee
* What I spent in the first 3 months: $1,900. Alot of this was panic Amazon buying of more sleepers or different bottles/pacifiers and over half was probably not necessary. Some of the bigger things I needed to buy was a hands free breast pump ($100), formula in bulk ($300, we supplment with formula so this will last us at least 3 months), a Loveevery year long subscription ($450, definitely not necessary). No daycare these months as I was out on leave.
* What I've spent in the last 1.5 months: $800 and most of that was from buying things I needed as she got more mobile, like an infant insert to her stroller so she'd be more comfortable, a pump bag so I could bring my breast pump with me when we went out, swim lessons, etc. And then more clothes as she got bigger, though I did get most of those at garage sales or resale stores. 
* So out of the money we saved before she was born we still have about half of it. It's nice to have a buffer but our spending with her has gone way down as I am better at getting clothes for her I know are functional and not waste money on others (double zippers only!) We also have not bought diapers since she was a newborn as we have had plenty from our baby shower and probably enough until she moves to size 3 in a month or so. So I'm expecting $400 a month in misc. to be about right, if I go over I'll draw from the sinking fund.",IndyEpi5127

FinancialPlanning,Is $30K enough of a cushion for family planning?,DukesMum24,"honest question: for regular people who’s life savings/whole emergency fund is probably not much more than 30k, what do they do in these situations? how can anyone plan for an unexpected medical cost of $30k?

FinancialPlanning,Is $30K enough of a cushion for family planning?,DukesMum24,"This is very helpful, thank you. $2,000-$2,500 a month is what we expect will be the cost of a child,  but that severely limits our ability to put money into savings. Sigh.",DukesMum24
FinancialPlanning,Is $30K enough of a cushion for family planning?,DukesMum24,"Yes, we did both.  We called are carrier and asked them what the cost might look like.  We later drilled the hospital to see if there was even a remote possibility that they would ever call in someone from out of network to treat my wife (OBYN’s, Anesthesia, nurse practitioners or other experts).

We passed on our first choice hospital because they were vague.  We said, “ We need a guarantee of in network or no business…”",bigblue2011
FinancialPlanning,Is $30K enough of a cushion for family planning?,DukesMum24,"It’s hard.  I feel it too, I’m also a regular person and there is no way I could absorb a surprise 30k bill. 
There are programs for people who are uninsured and underinsured, payment plans, etc. through hospitals. I’m not an expert on those financial programs, but I know they’re there and a patient advocate/social worker can help connect patients to them. Knowledge is power in this situation. Depending on the circumstances, portions of the bill can end up being written off/discharged. I hope someone in the sub can be more specific.

The best thing you can do when you know in advance is to actively call your insurance beforehand and make sure the birth hospital is in network, the attending OBGYNs there are in network (including the people who would be covering for your own OB since babies come when they want to!) Check anesthesia coverage, NICU coverage, be very thorough. If you don’t know what to ask, talk to your OBGYN and find out what to ask. The best scenario is making sure everything is covered or you know what won’t be.",SojiCoppelia
FinancialPlanning,Is $30K enough of a cushion for family planning?,DukesMum24,"I completely understand but it is completely normal for savings to take a backseat when kids are super young. The super expensive childcare only lasts for a few years (though older kids aren't necessarily cheap either) but at the same time, you'll be getting raises hopefully that can go towards savings. 

Save as much as you can before baby and then through compounding interest it will still be working for you even if you can't add to it much for a few years.",IndyEpi5127

FinancialPlanning,What happens if theres not enough to meet 401k contribution,Key-Target-1218,"Depends on how your 401k plan is set-up. Some employers will track your contributions against the limits and only let you contribute _upto_ that limit (ie. in your example, they’ll let just $100 out of the additional $200 go into your 401k). 

However, some employers may not track this so it may be the case where they let the full $200 go into the account, and then you’ll have to work on getting the excess $100 of “over contributions” back out of the account by going through a “Return of Excess” procedure, or “ROE”. Lengthy and requires paperwork,  but that would be the fix.

Sit down with your partner with your last 3 months of income, bills rent etc .If you're excel savvy you may want to use that. 

Set out your expenses and see where your money goes and see how much is feasible to nest away for your down payment. If you don't already I would work on an emergency fund of 3-6 months of your combined income.

In California, you will just do what I termed most my life as ""tread water"". You make enough to pay rent in a decent area, you got a bump cause family gives you cheap rent, without it would barely be nice for normal market rents now. 

So treading water is rents and costs eat up your oay raises, rents in crease homes increase just enough to where what you saved doesn't matter anymore. And you just get stuck in the mud.

FinancialPlanning,What happens if I close an old Roth IRA that's not really an IRA anymore?,Sarcastic_Sushi,"A Roth IRA is a container for investments.

Just because the money wasn’t invested doesn’t take away the account’s status as a Roth IRA.

All of the rules are the same.

You are allowed to take out the contributions at any time. You would be penalized and taxed on the withdrawal of any earnings before age 59.5. If there are no earnings, you are free to take out the full balance.

I would suggest finding another option though, withdrawing the money is a bad long term decision.

If you do decide to keep it, transfer it to a low cost brokerage like Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity. Wells Fargo and other banks aren’t the best place to keep a Roth IRA.",cwazycupcakes13
FinancialPlanning,What happens if I close an old Roth IRA that's not really an IRA anymore?,Sarcastic_Sushi,"From my understanding, Roth IRAs aren’t taxed when you take money out because the money was taxed before your dad invested or put it into the Roth IRA account.

Also, I need the money to assist in a downpayment on a house. I have my own teacher retirement account, a 401k and another IRA I've set up on my own , so this $2000 is something I need now, rather than worrying about reinvesting, but thank you for the advice.",Sarcastic_Sushi
FinancialPlanning,What happens if I close an old Roth IRA that's not really an IRA anymore?,Sarcastic_Sushi,"Yep, you’re good.

It’s actually not even account specific. All Roth IRA contributions are considered in aggregate, and all contributions come out first before earnings. So after you take out the 1935, you’ll have 65 of contribution basis left. You can use that in the future, against a withdrawal from any Roth IRA account, even if you haven’t opened it yet.

You will want to get the tax records or statements from Wells Fargo showing the contribution. The 5498 from the contribution would be ideal, just in case the IRS asks you to prove that your withdrawal is only of contributions.",cwazycupcakes13

FinancialPlanning,What should I do with my inheritance money?,myku42l,"Not an expert but paying off all the debts sounds like a good option. Bonds wil yield you 5.5% right now so paying off the CC debt and the vehicle one is a must do thing because you're going to be paying more interest than the yield you would generate on an investment in bonds. As US bonds are yielding 5-5.5% you could squish that 0.15-0.65% from the difference between student loan interest and the yield, but paying it all off would give more peace of mind. The remaining $15k keep them in a HYSA and keep saving there till you get enough money to make a proper investment. After everything has been paid off you will be saving way more too.

After anything is set aside for taxes, it definitely sounds like paying off the debt should be a priority, but I’d actually start by setting aside a portion for an emergency fund to make sure that you don’t end up needing to rely on debt in the future. After taxes and the emergency fund, it sounds like you have a good idea of what order to pay things off in, and based on how much you said you will be saving each year, it sounds like you will be able to pay off whatever is left.",No_Foundation1407

FinancialPlanning,Defined Benefits Pension Plan - do I still need to invest in RRSPs? (Canada),Extension-Rub-2952,"It depends.

What would you do with the cash if you didn't put it in the RRSP?  My thinking is you can't have too much money set aside for retirement, but you can starve yourself now trying to get there.

So think about the lifestyle you want -- the amount of time you and your wife have to spend the income you make.  Other goals like I dunno... saving for kids college.  Or a lake house.  Or annual vacations flying across an ocean.  Make sure you have money to live your life, but also make sure you also have enough money to live your life in retirement.

Sorry, not a very satisfying answer, is it?

I'm not sure what a ""TD Index"" is, but I think it's the equivalent to what we call an indexed mutual fund here south of the border.  We've done that too.

over 35 years ago, I started contributing to my 401k.  That was despite my corporate employer offering a pension.  my thinking:  between Social Security, Pension, and 401k, It would be hard to screw up.

35 years ago, I started at 5% into the 401k -- that was what would max out the company  -- 2% was a dollar-for-dollar match and the next 3% bought into profit sharing.  When we bought our house 5 years later, I reduced my contribution to 3%...did that for a few years, back to 5, then by 25 years ago I was all in, hitting the federal max for 401k contributions.  And, because our lifestyle was that of parents of young kids, we didn't travel much.  we had our house.  we think it wasteful to buy new cars every two years.  So we were able to invest more than just maxing out the 401k.  

So we went with mutual funds, much like you were thinking.  We could have gone IRA instead, but having money in a taxable investment account gave us flexibility before that money would be accessible.

Plus we saved for kids college.

Now, bearing down on the age where I can access my 401k without restrictions, I'm very happy with the path we chose.",micha8st

You need to raise your income or lower your living costs or both. I'd start by selling at least one car and anything else that isn't nailed down. That car debt is expensive, but the credit card debt is much worse. Try to refinance it. Your opportunities to refinance will get much worse as your debts continue to pile up. You don't need and can't afford streaming services. Look carefully at what else you're spending money on and save everything you can. Even ten bucks here and there will add up. 

You can't afford that medical bill. Make sure you check the itemised bill carefully for mistakes, duplicate charges, charges for services or costs you didn't incur. Try to negotiate the bill down. Ask the hospital for hardship assistance. 

You're both in an extremely vulnerable financial situation. You need to get ahead of this or your new family could easily end up bankrupt, carless, homeless and hungry. Needless to say even the strongest relationship would be at risk in that situation so you could add being a single mom to the list.

Let’s say your employer offers a 100% up to 5% match, and this match gets posted per pay period. In this instance, the plan _does not_ offer true up. 

For the sake of simplicity, let’s say you get one $10,000 paycheck a month and contribute 100% of it for the first two months. Your contribute rate is 100%, but your employer is only matching up to the first 5% _each pay period_. So for January they give you $500 in match, and in February they give you another $500 match. March, you can only contribute $2500, which is 25% of your paycheck. Again, they match $500. 

In this scenario, you maxed out your contributions by the end of March and received a total of $1500 in employer match. 

Now, let’s imagine you contributed 5% of your paycheck each month. By the end of the year, you would have contributed $6000 and you would have also received $6000 in employer match. 

This is why it’s important to know if your 401k plan offers true-up. True-up means your plan will give you the entire company match that you’re entitled to regardless of when you max out your contributions during the year.",PrincePryda

2.  If the student loans are your highest interest rate debt then use your savings to pay them down each month.  Try to pay more than what is required.  Ex. If your loan interest rate is 9% then you are earning a risk free 9% interest on your money simply by putting all your free cash to paying down this debt.
3.  Get a couple of the high end visa credit cards that offer big credit lines and begin using them for daily purchases and set up auto pay to pay them off in full each month.  This will quickly boost your score to high 700s and you need a good score to get the best car loan and mortgage deals later on.
4.  If you have extra, open a ROTH IRA account at Etrade or elsewhere and contribute to it each year.  Investment gains in ROTH accounts grow tax free so over 20 years that adds up.

FinancialPlanning,"First “real” job post college, what should I do to make the most of my income now and for the future?",Ok_Answer_3663,"PLEASE set up an emergency fund, first and foremost.  There are different recommendations how to do that but at least a month or two of basic living expenses (rent, utilities, gas, food).  

Establish a budget/spending plan and track your expenses.  It makes sense to look at your past expenses and establish a budget using that information. 

Then I would focus on investing in a 401k with employer match or a Roth IRA.  Nothing fancy, a basic Vanguard S&P 500 index mutual fund. Do not screw yourself by being overzealous with investing when you are still in debt and just starting out. There is no point to investing if you can’t afford to pay off debt and feed yourself. 

Next, I would pay off the student loans. 

In the meantime, you can consider ways to minimize costs/maximize savings.  Consider your commuting costs.  Either use mass transit or sell the car for something easier on gas, but do not increase a car payment. 
IF you open a credit card, check out a cash back option.  You can put your daily spend on it and pay yourself back. But ONLY do this IF you are positive you can pay it off, stay in budget, and be responsible.  If you get stuck paying interest because you can’t pay it off and went over budget, do NOT get a credit card or stop using it.

It can be nerve wracking to see the money debited and not deposited. But 401k rollovers are usually done with paper forms and snail mail. Fidelity will process the paperwork and the check when they get it.

Give them some time. If it never ends up at Fidelity, you have recourse. It probably will, but if it doesn’t, your money is not lost in the ether. They can always reissue a check.

They’re making sure it’s processed properly on both ends.",cwazycupcakes13
FinancialPlanning,How long will my 401K transfer take?,siewill2467,"If it's any consolation, these companies move money around as their business and they're pretty good at it. 

Timing depends on method of delivery.  Even an electronic transfer can take 1-3 business days.  But as weird as it sounds, many retirement transfers are still done by mailing a check.  It's slower, but there's actually less chance of things going wrong.  A physical object in meatspace can be easier to track and there's less risk of a dumb typo having the money end up in the wrong account.  

So if your old 401k provider mailed the check to Fidelity, it could take up to a week to arrive, then another day or so to process the deposit.

However, sometimes as an additional security step, the check may get mailed to **you**, even when the ""payee"" on it is made out to Fidelity.  This way the old provider knows the money has been handed off to the address in their records for the original account owner (also shifting responsibility to you, which is annoying).  This can mean up to a week for it to show up in your mail, you put into a new envelope to forward to Fidelity (do **not** endorse or cash this check), another week to get to Fidelity, then again a day or so to deposit.

Ultimately, being un-invested for a week (or even two) is going to have minimal impact on your overall lifetime performance.  You might even get lucky.  I had a multi-week 401k transfer happen, and during that time the market took a pretty big hit.  Since my balance was now sitting as an uncashed check, I didn't incur those losses like I would've if that money had been invested quicker.

FinancialPlanning,How to approach financial planning once you reach the income limits for IRA and 401k?,psjayay,"The 330k limit for 401k is not a phase out limit. That is the maximum amount that your employer can use for a percentage-based match. If your employer does a 10% match, for example, and you make 330k, you will get 33k from your employer. If you made 400k, you'd still only get 33k from your employer as a match. 

If you are maxing your 401k already, you can make a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA (only if it's empty, or this gets much more complicated). Then, you convert that contribution into a Roth IRA. 

If you already have a traditional and/or rollover IRA and want to do the backdoor Roth, you can roll your traditional IRAs into your workplace 401k, thereby leaving your traditional IRAs empty.

The IRS treats you as having one IRA, no matter of you have one or ten. So any pre-tax money you have in IRAs will make the backdoor Roth a perilous journey.",dunDunDUNNN

FinancialPlanning,How to approach financial planning once you reach the income limits for IRA and 401k?,psjayay,"Also, with the $330k limit, it's based on a running total of income for the year, so it's possible to under contribute in the first part of the year and be locked out of additional contributions once you hit $330k.

FinancialPlanning,How to approach financial planning once you reach the income limits for IRA and 401k?,psjayay,"That's correct. Once 330k is reached, the company is no longer allowed to contribute to the 401k on behalf of the employee. The employee MAY be able to continue contributing, but some plan documents will also bar the employee from continued contributions. 

So if this is the case, then your best bet is to overcontribute early in the year, or at least do your best to approximate when you will reach 330k of total compensation and have that be your target date for having maxed out your contributions. 

Hopefully, if you are one of these individuals, your company also has a ""make whole"" plan (non-qualified, therefore able to discriminate) so that you can receive the difference between your actual match vs. the same percentage company contribution as non-highly compensated employees if the 401a limit did not exist.",dunDunDUNNN

FinancialPlanning,Best plan for 250k currently in a CD,Inevitable-Lunch-751,Why do people like Bonds? They say it’s to “diversify” but the life of BND is negative lol and the yield is 3%. I could get a dividend fund that pays 1% greater and is at least even over its life with a decent chance for long term growth,AFrank96406
FinancialPlanning,Best plan for 250k currently in a CD,Inevitable-Lunch-751,"Several reasons.

One, Bond yields are actual yields of interest where Dividend yields are taken from the value from the asset holdings...it isn't the same thing.  Bond yields are actual income, Dividend yields are distributions.  Calling dividends income is a misunderstanding of what dividends are.  They are distributions of gains which result in an equal reduction in stock value.  When a bond yields 3% it does not reduce the face value of the bond by 3%.  That is why dividends are called distributions and bond yields are called interest.  If a bond yields 1% then you make 1%.  If a fund distributes a 3% dividend, then you make nothing.

Two, bond FUNDS have recently lost significant value because increasing interest rates decreases the value of bonds that were bought prior to increasing rates.  In other words a 5 year bond with a 1% yield is much less valuable now that a newly purchases 5 year bond has a 5% yield.  Therefore the bond funds holding 5 year bonds with 1% yields will drop significantly.  As they offload their older bonds or they mature and they use the money to acquire new bonds the yield of the fund will increase and if in future interest rates drop the value of the bond fund as a whole will increase.  Right now buying bonds is like buying low.  Over a long period that will equalize as interest rates cannot continue to climb forever and higher rates just mean higher yields.

Three holding bonds decreases volatility.  A full stock portfolio might range from 40% gains to 50% losses with regards to the major drawdowns versus peak gains.  If you add in bonds bonds tend to have lower gains but also much lower drawdowns (typically, the last year was an exception for the reasons stated above).  As you approach retirement it is good to reduce volatility as a 50% drawdown close to retirement can be devastating.  Picture it this way.  If your portfolio loses 50% of its value after you have been investing for 30 years then that is the equivalent of cutting ALL the previous 30 years of gains in half.  If your portfolio averaged a 10% annual return over a 30 year period that one year of 50% drawdown would make it be that over the last 30 years your entire portfolio averaged only 5% annual return.  Also to recover from a 50% drawdown you would need to gain 100% which likely will take many years.  If you are about to start fund withdrawls that will just lock in your loses.

So, as you approach retirement, the general advice is to migrate holdings from 100% equity towards 60% equity and 40% bonds which will significantly tamp down major drawdowns.

Switching your investments to something new every time something outperforms in the current year is the equivalent of trying to constantly switch lanes in traffic whenever one lane starts to move again.  It doesn't really help and quite often it actually makes things worse.  Not a perfect analogy because constantly switching investments to change the current assets that are at a high is a terrible idea where the lane switching in traffic is just sort of a waste or sometimes is appropriate.  Investment isn't about picking the thing that has done exceedingly well in the last 5 years.",Grevious47

FinancialPlanning,ESPP down 88%. Is it time for me to give up and sell?,pilgrim119,"Returns on investment = (future value / present value) - 1.

Example, if you have $1, and put it in a bond that will pay  $1.10 in 1 year. ($1.10/$1.00) - 1 = a 0.10% return. 

So an 88% loss on $100 means: 

-88% = (future return/$100) - 1, add the 1 to the 88%

0.12 = future return/$100, multiple each side by $100

$12 = future return 

To get back to $100, plug it in the equation and solve: 

Return = ($100/$12) - 1.

Return = (8.33) - 1 

Return = 7.33

Expressed as a percentage, Return = 733%

Now, as to why this is so counterintuitive, it’s because when buy something for $100, it’s challenging to believe it’s only now worth $12.

FinancialPlanning,Change in Income affect Roth IRA?,CameronPack,"Income restrictions for IRAs simply determine whether (and how) you can contribute _new money_ to the account. The money that’s already in there is unaffected. 

That said, you can continue to add new money to a Roth regardless of your income by using the strategy known as the backdoor Roth. You can Google it for more info and step-by-step instructions, but it amounts to this: 

1. Contribute money to a regular IRA at whatever brokerage you do business with. Anyone can contribute to an IRA regardless of income, but there are rules about who can take a tax deduction for their IRA contribution. You won’t be taking a tax deduction, however. This is what’s called a nondeductible contribution — it’s after-tax money. 

2. Immediately tell your brokerage to convert that contribution to Roth and move it into your existing Roth IRA. Remember, it’s after-tax money, just like Roth contributions are. 

3. When you file your taxes for the year, report the nondeductible IRA contribution and the Roth conversion on Form 8606, and you’re set.

In the end, this is another insurance product that more than likely doesn’t really help you out. TSP doesn’t have many options but you can rollover to IRA instead.

Even if your son doesn't go to college, worst case, you can still take out the money and give it to him. Yes, there's a penalty, but you'll lose far less money than you would've paid in fees for a VUL policy.

Honestly at least for our state, the 529 plan does manage the money you put into it. I put the money in and based on the kid's age it automatically selects funds to stick it in (mostly target date funds based on their expected graduation date).

If you really want to avoid 529s, and open a traditional account for them. You need to decide if it's an account you own or they own.

The 529 does still have limitations though if your goal is for your son to use it as he is going through life, prior to retirement. 

You could also consider an UGMA/UTMA account. The account has some tax advantages and is more flexible if you’re unsure of what you want the funds to be used for.

You can withdraw contributions and earnings from a Roth IRA without penalty for certain things and a house is one of them.

I’ll be honest. A few hours of reading will get you to a point of investing in your own. If you still don’t want to read, you could look at Fidelity GO. It’s a managed account for brokerage, IRA, 529, etc. or whatever. It might be an option for you.

The reason I suggest a 529 rolled over to a Roth IRA if no college is so he doesn’t lose money. You can open a brokerage account and have it managed, which takes away his money due to fees. Once he needs the money he will sell his shares and have a taxable event, therefore losing more money.

When I say it only takes a few hours of reading about index funds I really mean it. I buy two funds in a brokerage account, one fund in a Roth IRA, and one fund in a Trad IRA. I pay fees to no one to manage it.

Just some things to think about. You could mention all this to your financial advisor to ask for clarification what different accounts are. Just be sure to ask what the accounts are otherwise he will dismiss them and try to sell you something else.",MrBalll

You could change the beneficiary of the 529 to another child, or you or your spouse if you decided to go back to school.

My advice would be don't save 70k in the 529. It sounds like your own retirement accounts need 70k more than your kid does. 

If you want your kid to have access to the funds, why would you lock it up in a VUL policy and pay an insurance company to fleece you out of some growth?

Here are your options:

529 - state tax deduction, tax-free growth, can be rolled to a Roth IRA (and he can access the contributions, just not the growth)

UTMA - the funds belong to the child as soon as they go into the account. He receives access when he reaches the age of majority, and you have zero say over what he does with the funds

Savings account - its safe, it's yours so you can decide when and where to give it to him and for what purpose, you lose out on long term growth potential

Taxable account - capital gains tax when liquidated, but depending on when and how he'll pay either 0% or 15% (if transferred to him, if the account is in your name you get to pay the tax)",dunDunDUNNN

If USA and federal, is that 540 a combination of the TSP (5% gross pay, which you electively can reduce but shouldn’t as that is the minimum to get the gov maximum matching contribution, ie extra 5% free money) and your portion of the FERS annuity (4.4% of gross pay)

There’s a section on the federal Student Financial Aid website https://studentaid.gov that gives a good overview of the aid system. It’s possible that you can make smart choices now about the school(s) you plan to attend and the non-loan aid available, so you will be able to limit your loan debt to about $20,000 in federal subsidized debt for your undergraduate degree. You would not need a good credit history to qualify for federally-backed loans.

If your aim is eventually a doctoral program (MD, DDS/DDM, JD, PhD, Pharm), limiting your undergrad debt would still be a good idea - again, unless someone else (an employer, the military, major scholarship) is paying for your professional degree, that’ll be hundreds of thousands of dollars of student loans that will be offered with you needing little to no credit history.

Have you been applying to schools, yet?  Have you explored any community colleges that may be close to you, so you can take undergrad general education courses that will transfer to a public university, but cost less than taking the same courses at university? Have you spoken to a school counselor about scholarships you might be eligible to apply for? Have you and your parents used the FAFSA forecast tool, to determine how much you may be offered in federal/state grants, and how much you/your parents would be expected to contribute?

(One of my assistants last year came from a very poor family. He attended university while he couch surfed between various relatives. He kept his grades high enough to be accepted at Yale law school, full-ride scholarship plus $25k per year in loans offered by Yale itself for living expenses. The great part about those loans from Yale is that they would be partially or completely forgiven over a ten-year period after he graduated. His undergrad loan debt is only $20k, so he is going to have a very easy time with loan repayment once he graduates. That’s the kind of scenario it would be good to work towards - maximum education, minimal debt.)",DesignatedVictim

FinancialPlanning,Pay down mortgage or save into HYSA?,Majestic_Courage,So this isn’t as cut and dry as most lead on to believe.  What is your tax bracket?  You have to still make sure that your after tax yield is still higher than your mortgage rate for it to make sense to invest it rather than pay it off.  If you have a big enough mortgage to itemize your taxes and write off mortgage interest than it may be an added benefit of keeping the mortgage.  If you are taking the standard deduction and your after tax yield is less than your mortgage rate then you should pay off the mortgage.,countryfish47

FinancialPlanning,Pay down mortgage or save into HYSA?,Majestic_Courage,"Generally speaking, if you can earn more than the debt is costing you, do so.

Granted, after taxing the gains, there's not a whole lot of spread, but the HYSA will still yield you more.

There are other considerations as well. Let's say your after tax yield on the HYSA was exactly 3.25% (or even a bit less). I'd still opt for liquidity over paying down the mortgage. You could always build up that savings and then lump-sum if it you wanted to be debt free, while retaining access to those funds in the meantime.   Imagine if you faced an emergency, job loss, etc., and needed access to your home equity at a time when you could no longer qualify for a home equity loan?

Then you can consider it in terms of inflation.  3.25% fixed for 30 years is very cheap money. Less than the real rate of inflation. This means you'll be paying that down in the future with less valuable dollars, in a very real sense, letting inflation ""inflate away your debt"" all the while growing that extra money in the HYSA  (or other investment)",StumbleMyMirth

FinancialPlanning,Pay down mortgage or save into HYSA?,Majestic_Courage,"Congrats on having an amazing “problem” you’re crushing it

HYSA are over rated, good for emergency cash but statistically don’t make sense beyond that. They are a flight to safety but investing is about calculated risk and the long haul. When we are talking about a mortgage there is likely over 20 years to consider and that would qualify as a long time horizon to me

At that interest rate investing in the stock market will outperform the cost of the interest. Beyond the Great Depression the worst 20yr return on the S&P 500 is about 6%, including the Great Depression there is 1 year with below 5%. These are worst case historical scenarios and at a capital gain tax rate of 15% they would still easily out perform the cost of the interest. 
In general if interest is under 5% I’d pay the minimums and invest the difference 

Related to HYSA, historically bond funds outperform cash (HYSA) in the 12 mo following the end of federal rate hikes. 4-5.5% HSYAs are nice but there is an opportunity cost to them.

You can do it yourself in low cost index funds if you want or if you prefer the guidance of a professional find a fiduciary Financial Advisor you trust.

This is incorrect. If you pay $10k today on a 3.25% mortgage you will actually save about $16k in interest over the course of thirty years.

At which time you could evaluate again and make a new decision.
Plus you have liquidity of that $10425 still and it isn’t locked up in home equity 

Over 30 years that 10k would become 34k +24k well over the $16k you save, the power of compounding return.

Then, at the minimum, it makes more sense to put the money into a HYSA now and then use that money to pay the mortgage down later if savings interest rates drop precipitously.

I would argue that it makes more sense to dump anything outside of your emergency fund into VTI or similar, which has historically grown by way more than the 3.25%, but that's not what OP is asking.

FinancialPlanning,A future of despair. No plans/retirement at age 40,inadayzZz,"OK, let's do the math.

$19.50/hour for 40 hours a week for 52 weeks is about $41K for the year. Federal income taxes should be about $3,000, FICA (7.65%) also about $3,000, maybe $1,000 state income tax, so annual take home is about $34K. Sound about right?

Adding up your expenses I total $1,340 or about $16K a year. That leaves about $18K.

Let's say your other expenses (for example, groceries, clothing, etc) are $1,000 a month, or $12,000 for the year. Total expenses, $30K.

That leaves you $4K annually to invest. Put it into VTI in a Roth via a Vanguard brokerage account. Over 25 years, with a 9.97% return (stocks return about 10%, less the .03% expense charge, you'll accumulate about $400K by the time you are 65. At 4%, that can supplement your social security by about $16K a year the first year.

If you can scrimp elsewhere and shave off some expenses, perhaps you can contribute the full $6,500, which over 25 years would compound to about $630K. And maybe you increase the amount annually as the limit goes up, so $1MM at 65 is not out of the question.

It's doesn't matter where you've been, it's where you are going. Owning VTI in a Roth in a Vanguard brokerage account is pretty simple for anyone who has bought anything online. You can likely set it up to do it monthly over the next 25 years. But see if a simple plan like this will work for you.

OP may or may not get 10% returns over any given period of time. the US market can be flat for 10+ years. it's not an annuity. those online calculators can be misleading. 

in other words, that $400k estimate should be regarded with extreme caution. more accurate or realistic would be to cut it in half and say OP could realistically expect to accumulate between $200k and $400k over the next 25 years.",harrison_wintergreen

Vanguard is a mutually owned investment company, which means the investors own the company, and they provide their investment management services at cost. https://investor.vanguard.com/home

It may seem daunting, but Vanguard has done all the homework for you. The steps are pretty simple.

1. Open an account with Vanguard. You can do it online.
2. After the account is open, you will transfer money to Vanguard.
3. Using their brokerage tools, you buy the shares of VTI. It's not any more difficult than ordering something from Amazon.

I assume you have a bank account and a credit card or two. Go online and usually there will be export functions for any bank accounts or credit cards. Download them into spreadsheets and just add together the things that are alike (in Excel, you can use things like SUMIF formulas to add like items). It will also tell you what your income is (the bank part at least). 

Just doing the downloads is a lot simpler than using a money tracker app; you just have to aggregate a couple of sources. Obviously, don't count the payment on the credit card as an expense, because you have already downloaded what you actually bought with the credit card.

Figure our what the big rocks are. Rent, car, food, etc. See where you can economize. You will also see how much you are making.

You can do all of this in a relatively short time. Once you know how much is going in and where's it's going, you can develop a budget based on those numbers.

First, subtract the necessities that are always the same amount, things like rent, car payment, car insurance, phone bill, etc. 

Then subtract the necessities that are variable, but you don't have total control over: gas, electric, planning for oil changes, etc.

Next are necessities that you can probably spend less money on: things like shampoo (can you buy a less expensive brand?), groceries (same thing), etc. Think of everything you buy and look for ways to save money. Look for sales, store brands, check unit prices at the grocery store. you don't always have to go with the cheapest whatever, but saving money in one place gives you more money to spend elsewhere. 

Next, budget something to put in savings for emergencies. It doesn't have to be a lot, but it should be something that you automatically save. Ideally, have it taken directly from your paycheck and deposited into a savings account so you don't even see it. 

Once all of your necessities are budgeted out, you'll see what is left over for eating out, alcohol, weed, clothes that you don't actually need, etc. As long as you don't dip into the money budgeted for needs, you're not going to overdraft your account.

More specifically it wasn’t because “oh we like X, Y or Z” it was a matter of convenience. We would both be tired from work, it’s just easier to have food show up vs cooking sometimes. 

So what I do now is on Sunday I cook 2 meals for dinner. So if I make Chicken, Rice and Veggies I’ll also make Steak, Potato’s and Veggies, I make enough for 4 meals of each. I put 6 servings worth in food prep containers, freeze 2 and store 4 in the fridge for the week. Then we cook dinner throughout the week, take salads with just chicken on the side to work and we have 4 meals ready to be reheated for when we don’t feel like cooking. Come Saturday, we typically have 2 left so we will eat those, then prep on Sunday again. 

Now we only eat out when we go on dates (we try twice a month) or if we are simply just craving something. I think over the last 3 months we’ve only eaten out 6-7 times not including anniversary and when a family member was in the hospital. It’s saved us quite a bit of $$.",SiggySiggy69

I once realized that I was not actually tracking all my subscriptions and it was a lot. I mean I once did but then I got a gf who had 2 kids and she made a lot of money but we were still kind of always broke since we started over together and needed to buy a lot of things and we wanted the childhood for the kids that we both didn't have.

Anyway, so we had pretty much everything; Apple TV+, 2TB iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Arcade (it has surprisingly good games like NBA 2K for only $6 per month), Amazon Prime, Kindle, Disney+, Crave (HBO Max in Canada), Netflix, GamePass Ultimate and more. I always tried to eat at home since I honestly cook better than pretty much any place unless we want something specific that can't be replicated but she loved to just go out and be served even though that's how it was at home anyway since I did all the cooking. 

In the end, we spent a shit ton of money we didn't have to. I mean we had a full kitchen. We had everything I could possibly need to make different kinds of tartare, many steaks, grilled chicken, fried chicken, lots of pasta, soup, always had potatoes and anything else you can think of to make anything from scratch really.

By not going out as much or getting so many useless subscriptions, I save hundreds per month now.

FinancialPlanning,"HELP. My boyfriend and I are broke and hopeless, and we don’t know where to begin",Dr_Llamacita,"It’s too early to talk to a financial advisor. You need to do basics first. 

1. You and the BF need to get on the same page and commit to doing something about your spending. Not going to work if only one of you is on board. 
2. Sit down with paper and write down your fixed expenses: rent, utilities, car payments, insurance etc. Food is NOT a fixed expense. More on that later. Deduct these from your monthly net income. 
3. Stop pretending restaurants, bars, cafes or delivery are a solution to feeding you and slaking your thirst. You can’t afford it. Once a week and some special occasions can be okay, but otherwise, learn to shop for groceries effectively and cook. If can’t cook, learn. If you feel light drinking enriches your life, have the beer or glass of wine at home. Eating out too much is one of the single biggest economic bad decisions in the world. It is bleeding you dry. Assign a daily budget for food that fits within your means and do not be too generous at the start or it’s going to make you lazy and you’ll still spend too much. 
4. After you’ve deducted 2 & 3, look at what you’ve got left and consider how much you can set aside to save while still being able to live like a human being on the rest. Look seriously at things you can reasonably reduce. There are other insurance companies, other phone plans and you could look into moving to reduce rent. 
5. Don’t go shopping just because. You shop if you actually need something, not to make yourself feel better (unless it’s very very cheap and not often) and consider the economy of each choice you make. 

That’s where you begin. The core value is to change your attitude and instill some discipline into yourselves. Other people do it. You can too.",Leighgion
FinancialPlanning,"HELP. My boyfriend and I are broke and hopeless, and we don’t know where to begin",Dr_Llamacita,"Identify wants and needs. Try to go to stores like aldi or Trader Joe’s (hell even Walmart) instead of your big box stores. This will help you safe when grocery shopping which really can help a balanced budget succeed. 

But store brand items when possible and try to find the cheapest options on food and entertainment. If you drink beer there is nothing wrong with getting Milwaukees best for a while. 

Take a hard look at your accounts and see what the most common drain on your money is and find anyways to either cut it out completely or maybe lower the cost. 

If you are severely broke, cut every single streaming service you subscribe to for the time being until you recover and then identify what you can actually afford. Anything that can be considered a luxury, you should evaluate and cut out if possible.

Start setting money aside for the future. When I was a server, every night when I got off I put money aside in a box to save hard cash. Maybe start with $25 a shift and work your way up from there.

Also since you are a server and already want a career change. Hustle as much as you can! I’m talking about going above and beyond got guests and breaking the rules to please them and in return get more tips. I knew a server at Crackerbarrel who was able to make around 100,000 a year simply because she knew and mastered the hustle. 

Then when you do start ti become financially stable, always remain on top of your bank account. Be knowledgeable about all the purchases that go in and out and optimize what items you save on. And don’t get any sort of credit until you 100% believe you can use it as a tool and not a crutch.

Hope this helps. May not be the best advice but it has helped me through times of financial hardship. Good luck!!",gabenslittlehelper

FinancialPlanning,"HELP. My boyfriend and I are broke and hopeless, and we don’t know where to begin",Dr_Llamacita,"Here's one way to instantly stop ""leaking"" money every day. Stop buying food from restaurants/shops! This is something that's become so commonplace, become such an accepted practice that everybody does, no one even thinks about it.

Get one of those old school lunch boxes, the kind with a small thermos inside. Make a sandwich (or salad) and take that to work with you. Include snacks, like fruit, raisins, etc. Do you ""grab a coffee"" at Starbucks on your way to work every day? That's what the thermos is for. From now on, make coffee at home and bring it with you. Get a steel water bottle and bring water from home, too. No more buying bottles of something you get for free at home.

You may want to invest in a nice coffee maker, and buy high quality coffee beans, blends, etc. That'll still save you a lot of money compared to buying specialty coffees from shops. You may also want to buy a Britta water filter-- whatever it takes to break the habit of buying bottled water.

Also, invest in an Instant Pot. There are a million low-cost meals you can easily make with one of those. (Look on YouTube.) An inexpensive air fryer is another great investment in easy cooking that produces tasty results.

The point is, from this point onward, no more paying for restaurant food. It takes discipline to anticipate what you'll need and buy the ingredients, then to prepare the meals at home, then to clean up your pans and dishes. But you're no longer paying others to do those things, as you're doing them for yourself.",monadyne

FinancialPlanning,"HELP. My boyfriend and I are broke and hopeless, and we don’t know where to begin",Dr_Llamacita,"I was in a very similar situation to you.

My son was just born, I lost my job, I went -$55k in debt, was extremely addicted to hard drugs, and was about to lose my family (wifey was overwhelmed and was going to leave if I didn’t change my habits)

It takes a whole lot of sucking up your pride/ego and just telling yourself, you will have to hustle hard for the next 3-5 years.

I took on three jobs, delivery driver at night, corporate food delivery dude during the day, and assistant to a realtor on the weekends. I hustled.

We shared a 2 bed / 1 bath with 4 other people (7 total including my son).

Your mindset has to change as well. You have to stop being the victim. Take responsibility for everything. 

Tips I can give you:

- consolidate your debts asap. I know rates suck and inflation is high. Consolidate and know what debts you have.

- eat at home only. Make all your meals. It suck’s, but every penny counts.

- learn about the basics of finances. I was never taught this. Build your savings/rainy day reserves first. Understand your income/expenses to a T. Use apps like Mint to help. There are tons of free YouTube videos about this topic that can teach you the very basics to start.

- don’t invest in assets, stocks, etc.. yet. Invest in YOURSELF. Literally try to learn a new skill that can progress your career. Go study like your life depends on it. Put that money back into investing in a hard skill set (trade skills are awesome career choices)

- this is hard, but STOP using and make it known to your ‘circle’ that you are not a user. Drugs although fun, can and will ruin you. Get healthy, clean your body up and it’ll start clearing up your mind (you’ll have clarity—it’s awesome)

- once you got a plan in place, things becomes 
 easier. Things fall into place and the challenges are more or less predictable and less scary.

Good luck! And don’t forget, your partner is in it with you, not against you. It may seem that way because you’re both stressed 🙏

The fact that you came here to write this in such an honest way is a huge step that frankly most people never even dare to take. Your attitude sets you ahead of so many other people already.

I (37/m) grew up in a very similar situation where my parents drank and didn't control their money well. My older sister also showed me that a different path was possible by becoming successful and avoiding many of the vices of our parents. I floated around aimlessly until about age 27 when I finally landed a steady job that had a decent career trajectory. I created a simple spreadsheet where I accounted for my net worth and realized I was 50k in debt due to student loans.

From then on, even though my pay was still very low, I managed to pay double the payment amount on those loans every month and then still set aside another couple hundred dollars for investments.

It was extremely gratifying to see my net worth rise steadily every month, and especially also knowing that my career would also advance and that my financial ascent would get even better as time went on. That spreadsheet became an important document to me which I still hold sacred to this day.

While there are always struggles in life, my fiance and I live well under our means and sleep much better for it. I honestly couldn't handle living paycheck to paycheck anymore as it just isn't worth the anxiety. With regards to finances, I am a much different person than I was 10 years ago.

I had a minor mental breakdown about the whole ordeal, and I felt like I took a risk by disclosing the fact that I didn’t even have a few hundred extra dollars to my name to him and that I lived paycheck to paycheck. Turns out it was a good move. He then disclosed to me that he was being sued by someone because of a fender bender and we commiserated with each other because of our financial woes. It brought us closer together, and a year later, I’ve never loved or felt more loved or understood by another person in my life. I’ve never felt more willing and able to be honest with another human, especially about financial shit. It’s just that I’m so tired of us accepting this reality as just a part of living under capitalism, and I see better things for us in the future. It’s true that the current system is bent on widening the wealth gap and making poor people like us even poorer, but that doesn’t mean that we have to resign ourselves to that bullshit.

I didn’t realize it’s a Dave Ramsey quote and people have mixed feelings about the guy but I think it’s a good quote

My wife (then gf) and I were in a very similar situation to the two of you. We felt like we were always broke and didn’t feel like we spent much money at all. We overdrafted all the time and generally had a miserable relationship with our money (great relationship with each other)

I downloaded a budgeting app and tracked every single penny spent. Every. Single. Penny. 

The app let you categorize things so I did, rigorously. If I was buying a bag of chips or a soda, it went into junk food/ fast food. Gas had an entry, car repairs had an entry, groceries had an entry. Everything had a category entry. I’ll admit we didn’t cut everything out on month 1, that probably would have saved us a lot of time. Instead, we tracked rigorously for as long as I can remember.

The immediate benefit was that we knew our bank balance down to the penny. Relying on the bank website or bank app was tricky because gas pumps sometimes have delays, or restaurant tips or other transactions. Knowing our real time bank balance down to the penny nipped the overdrafts pretty quickly, so that was a win. Overdrafts are expensive af 

Secondly, I ran a report after a couple of months, which surprisingly was a feature of this blackberry app. The sickening part of the report was that from January to April, I had spent $1400 on junk food. Red Bulls, random bag of chips, candy bar, soda from the food court, starbucks. Just plain shit that I didn’t NEED. It was literally sickening and almost immediately resulted in me cutting out junk food. 

Next we saw that gas was one of our biggest expenses, and that it had previously been one of our top reasons for overdrafting. You’re on E but you gotta get to work right? So you stop at this gas station, buy some gas and some junk food because you might as well if you’re gonna be paying 34 extra. Now you’re late for work and in the hole. 

So with her permission we started averaging the amount of miles we travelled for work and rounded up a couple miles. I looked up the average fuel economy of the cars and the tanks capacity and rounded down a few miles (so like, car can get 300 miles per tank). Last I did the average cost of fuel and rounded up a few cents. Every time we got paid we moved money into a new account we made called “Gas”. We only ever used that account to put gas in the cars, and we only ever filled the tank. No junk food at the gas stations. This helped us not be late to work, and to always know we had a full tank of gas even if we were otherwise broke 

Since our gas was budgeted down to the mile with a few extra budgeted in for visiting family occasionally, we didn’t go out as much anymore, we didn’t buy junk foods overall it was a very “cut everything and everyone out for a bit” life.

It took a while but we got through it. We’re financially way better off and although a huge part of it is eventually getting higher paying jobs, I definitely think being more financially disciplined helped a lot.",TheMartinG
FinancialPlanning,"HELP. My boyfriend and I are broke and hopeless, and we don’t know where to begin",Dr_Llamacita,"You can also try slowly reducing the amount of times you go out, from 4 times a week the first month, to only twice a week the third month, etc. the point it, be diligent and see for yourself that the money will roll in.

YNAB is good, but so is Mint, which automatically categorizes your transactions. Quick tip, if you buy at a place like target, separate food versus personal items separately, into different receipts, so the categories don’t get mixed up. 

Also, once you figure out how much money you can save (by eating at home, etc), start a separate savings account, and have a portion of paycheck money go directly there so you’re not tempted to spend it. 

Automate budgeting and saving as much as you can.

Find a budgeting app that works for you. We grabbed EveryDollar because its simple (Mint was too complex for me) and holy shit the things we found we spent money are was so dumb. But the biggest one for us: eating out/bars. We were spending THOUSANDS of dollars a month on it. We weren't living lavishly, in our minds. We would just get takeout 3-4 nights a week, get an app and drinks every time we went out, drinks with friends on the weekend, eat every meal takeaway on Sundays because we were too hungover. No expense by itself was insane. But it adds up quickly when you do it enough.

Anyways, our habits didn't necessarily change right away (we were young and still wanted to go out) but it did bring everything to light and once that happened, we were able to pivot pretty quickly when we decided we wanted something different out of our financial lives.

FinancialPlanning,"HELP. My boyfriend and I are broke and hopeless, and we don’t know where to begin",Dr_Llamacita,"Dave Ramsey does have some MLM vibes and I would not recommend using services that he earns commissions on. Overall, his financial advice has a target audience, and his advice isn't terrible within that. His niche is people who struggle not to spend every dollar that is in their bank account/credit limit, regardless of how high that number is. 

If you are that person, then you should take most of his advice pretty fully. 

If you are not that person, then some of his advice isn't the best if you want to build wealth. He's very debt-averse, even in situations where taking on debt would have a solid payoff - like for graduate degrees **with solid career placement rates**. His debt payoff strategy isn't going to save you the most on interest (mathematically, you should pay high rate debt first and work your way down, and you should pay debt slowly if the interest is less than you earn in a high-yield savings account). Credit cards are not inherently bad (and even provide good rewards and purchase protection) but you HAVE to have the discipline to pay them off in full each month. 

Regardless of which person you are, his insistence on every dollar having a job is spot on.

Your plan may allow you to keep it in the 401k. This is only really advisable if you really like the investment options you get in the 401k that might not otherwise be available to you (e.g. getting the institutional discount rates for funds)",csdx
FinancialPlanning,"I left a job that provides 401K matching, what next?",ostrij,">I didn't think it through and left my 401k investment alone as is, no further investments have been made since I left.

That's because you literally can't add new money to a 401k after leaving that job.  401k contributions can only be done from your paychecks issued by the employer that set up that plan.  

Leaving it as-is probably wasn't too bad.  You're likely paying some sort of account fee (could be a low flat dollar amount, could be a % of balance) for it.  Employers often cover those fees, but that stops once you leave.  And its investments may not be as good as you could've had elsewhere.  Neither of those are catastrophes.

>Do I need to move it, or is it all the same? Where should I move it to? 

Well, you don't *need* to move it.  You can't contribute, but it'll remain invested and (hopefully) growing.  But having a bunch of disconnected accounts eventually gets tough to manage, so consolidating is usually a good idea.

Do you have any other retirement account?  You say your new employer doesn't have a 401k, but there are other types of plans (403b, 457b) that are mostly compatible and could receive a ""rollover"" of your balance from this old 401k. 

Or you can open an IRA.  That's a personally-managed retirement account separate from any employer which can also be a destination of a rollover from this old 401k.  The usual recommendations are to open one with one of the ""big three"" brokerages: Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab.  There's not much practical difference which one.  

You do likely want to match the 401k's ""tax treatment"" with the destination IRA: either Traditional or Roth.  Roth 401k plans are less common, this old plan is probably all pre-tax, so would be rolled into a Traditional IRA.

>How do I contribute manually from my current paycheck?

Direct paycheck contributions really only works with an employer-provided plan.  More often, for an IRA you get your pay deposited into your bank account, then do a transfer from there into the IRA.  Some payroll systems allow you to split destinations to deposit to, and I think an IRA could be provided for one of those.  This bypasses some checks (like ensuring you're under the allowed annual contribution limit) and may not be able to be automatically invested, so that's generally more trouble than its worth.

The wiki over at the personalFinance subreddit has a good [section on retirement information](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index/#wiki_retirement).  That could be a good place to get further guidance / details.",sciguyCO

FinancialPlanning,What to do with a large lump sum?,plantlife1217,"I have never heard of the monthly expense CD idea from my circa 35 years of investing and I think it's insane. If you are both income earners, why would you put your year ahead expenses in a CD? You'll pay the expenses a year from now with the income you earn that month.

You want the money to grow over time, right? Open a taxable brokerage account with Vanguard and divide the $50K (or whatever amount) into suitable chunks--maybe five chunks of $10K each. Invest $10K in VTI now, $10K in 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and a year. Put the $10K into 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, and 1 year CDs to earn a little more, or just transfer the $40K to a Vanguard money market fund and earn 5+% without the hassle of buying CD's. Buying stocks over time is the simplest and best way to build wealth over time, and when you have extra money in the future, buy more shares of VTI, You can also look at VXUS to diversify internationally.

You don't need whole life insurance (I worked at two different insurance companies for 27 years as a CPA). You will do a LOT better buying the VTI. Perhaps term insurance for each of you, especially if you have kids in the future (depending on whether your employer offers insurance coverage, as some companies do).

You can put the $15K in a CD, but put the rest in stocks, and you will do the best over the long term.",Sagelllini
FinancialPlanning,What to do with a large lump sum?,plantlife1217,You have the right idea already and from what you said it sounds like you are financially conservative. Ideally putting your monthly living expense amount in a year long CD on the first of every month will give you the best return on your cash and if something happens you know you are ok for a year while adding a little every maturity date and rolling it over. Going forward maxing out your Roth IRA’s will give you the best tax advantages in the future since they aren’t taxed while they grow or when you take you distributions later on. Vanguard has some great mutual funds and EFT’s. Depending on your income if you can drop a tax bracket by contributing to your 401K can also give you substantial tax savings however you will pay taxes on your distributions later on but you can keep those at a minimum so it’s not so much as you will hopefully have the CD ladder later on anyways. Whole life insurance policies will also create an immediate estate if you plan on having children and they will receive the death benefits tax free.  While you can also protect yourselves with a joint decreasing term policy on the value of your home. So if something unfortunate happens you know you will have your home paid off. Pretty simple and straightforward. If you really want to pay off the car take a look at the amortization table of the interest left. If the interest you can make off the 5k is more then the interest you are paying for the remainder of the loan. I would say to take advantage of keeping your money as you never know what could happen and it will bring you in more cash.,Financial-Advisor-

Both are essentially stock shares that own other companies at a very low cost. The first invests in the US, the other outside of the US. Between both, you'd effectively own about 4,500 companies through out the world, including shares in all of the big ones.

You can read about the specific share at those links and about ETFs in general via Google.

Over time (historically) the share price grows and pays a dividend (US about 1.5%; the international higher). Stocks have been shown over time to grow the most; about 10% annually. Investments like CDs usually only grow about the rate of inflation, so give or take 3%. Up until the COVID shock, cash was paying virtually nothing for a LONG time, so today's rates are extremely unusual for about the past 10 years.

The risk of CDs is that you do not outperform inflation, so they are not without risk. It's just not a visible risk like with the daily fluctuations of stock prices. But over time, the daily stock price movement is just noise, and the prices tend to grow over time.",Sagelllini
FinancialPlanning,What to do with a large lump sum?,plantlife1217,"Thank you. Absolutely! As an example from the information you said your monthly living expense are around 30k a year. That’s 2,500 a month. Taking that 2,500 on the first of the month you would open a CD account for that amount every month in a one year CD. This money will be locked away for a year and interest will compound monthly. When the maturity date comes the following year if you need it it will be free to take or you can roll it into a new one and add say 500 or 1,000 to it, the more you can spare the better. Now not only are you covered for your monthly expenses in the future you are building a sizable amount without any worry of ever losing it. After 10 years that 2500 will now be 7500-12500 plus the compounded interest if you are adding the 500-1000 every year.  I did some basic math because I love doing this lol. If rates stay some how miraculously stay at 5% and you add 500 a year for 10 years it will be around the 9500 per a month and around 15k adding 1000 a year that’s before the 10th years interest. I will note adding 500 or 1000 a month to an aggressive growth mutual fund, ETF or S&P fund and reinvesting the dividends as well will grow at a much faster rate but unlike with the CDs the value is exposed to market cycles and will fluctuate day to day but you are looking at long term as you will want to slowly phase that out into something more predictable in your later years.",Financial-Advisor-

Optimizing investment returns is a mix of obtaining steady returns, minimizing fees and  minimizing taxes.  Minimizing taxes, means investing through IRAs or a 401k if you have one through your work.   Obtaining steady returns is generally done through maintaining a mix of stock and bond funds/etfs.  Minimizing investing fees/expenses is done through investing yourself in low cost index funds or etfs.  

You can do very well over time investing in a mix of 6-8 funds, S&P 500, small-cap, mid-cap, bonds, foreign stock, emerging stock, commodities and periodically re-balancing.  Having a tortoise mentality (slow and steady wins the race) can do wonders over 40 years.",Paladin936

First, figure out his spending needs. Use a current baseline or project something reasonable.

Then figure out the income from sources other than investments. That would include social security. By the way, if your dad is 55 he won't be able to collect SS until at least 62, so that's at least 7 years away.

FinancialPlanning,Best method for 20 year plan,itsmeandyouknowit1,"If spending all of it within 20 years is your goal then a 1/N strategy where N equals the number of years left will provide the most average annual income.  For example in year 1 you would divide the balance by 20, in year 2 by 19, year 3 by 18, etc.  This strategy will have a variable income per year but will be fully spent at the end of the 20 years.  If you implement this strategy you will want to make sure you are in a very diversified portfolio across several asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.).

I would caution against earmarking all of it to be spent.  According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute a couple will need $212,000 to have a 50% chance of covering their medical expenditures in retirement and $318,000 to have a 90% chance.  And that is with good to average health.  If they have high presticription drug expenditures they will need $383,000 to have a 90% chance of covering their healthcare cost.  It would be wise to set aside a portion of the $1,000,000 to cover this amount.

For example if you set aside $300k to cover future healthcare spending and invested the remaining $700,000 in a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio and withdrew using the 1/N strategy the historical average available spending being $113,136.30 per year (this takes into consideration the Social Security Income of $1800 per month now and $2,000 5 years from now.

Next ask yourself how much you’ll need for a three month emergency; your car died on you, you lose your job and need time to find another one. That money needs to start liquid so it stays in your high yield savings account. 

Next, do you have any debts? If you have credit card debt pay it off immediately. If you have a loan of some kind and it’s higher than what the market returns 8%) then pay those off as well.

Now it’s time to start setting up your retirement because you’re 23 and compound interest is going to make you a multi millionaire at 65. Why should you care? Getting from 65 to the grave costs about 2 million dollars, and even better if your retirement is set up then you can take so much more financial risk in your life with zero consequence to your future. This means you contribute to your Roth 401k and Roth IRA. You keep working and you keep setting up retirement until you hit this target number. I’m only talking about contributing $600 a month from today until 65 but you can contribute more and rather and stop if you choose to do so when you got that number.

Just say this: either I take the 2600 and only work 40 hours a week and get a side gig somewhere else or I be salary and get paid 3000 bi weekly to compensate no more overtime and get worked like a dog as needed.

benefit is that you get the guaranteed 3000 no matter how many hours you work, salary is a win, and honestly i’d take it regardless you may be getting less but say you get sick you still get that 2600, but based on your compensation history a match of 2900 should be an easy win",Afletch331

If you get four weeks PTO, then the salary would be more than if you got the hourly rate and took four weeks off. Now, if you’re not taking time off, and if you’re regularly getting overtime pay, that can change the equations. 

I don’t know if it makes a difference when you’re directly employed as hourly, but I know in my field (IT) it’s common for contractors to pull in a *much* higher hourly rate than a salaried employee doing the same role. But the contractor won’t get any benefits — no PTO, no employer-provided insurance, access to 401K, etc. So when figuring my desired hourly rate as a contractor, I have to figure all those things into my budget. 

So you need to look closely at your total compensation package, see what’s different between hourly and salaried, and see if the difference is worth it or not. In your case, it sounds like it might not be? 

Make yourself a spreadsheet to compare the yearly income and benefits (including an estimate of your overtime, time off, any reduction in health insurance rate, etc.).

So 12.3% of $2900 = about $356.  My that measure with that amount of extra PTO your $2900 paycheck is equivalent to $2544 bi-weekly.

You currently make 2900/biweekly at $24/hr.

80 hours at $24/hr gets you $1920 so there’s approx $1000 in ot. $24x1.5 is $36/hr for ot.

FinancialPlanning,Which loans would you focus on paying?,LegalDrugDeaIer,"There are 2 major philosphies on paying off debt:   
1. Snowball: Pay off the smallest bill first. This improves cash flow fastest. It also provides a mental reward for paying off the debt, which increases the chance someone will stick with their budget.   
2. Avalanche: Pay off the highest interest rate first. This minimizes the interest paid and gets people out of debt fastest.    

Sounds like you're about to buy a house.   
If you're doing <20% and getting PMI, I would prioritize 20% down on that first regardless of the method for paying off debt. The ROI on hitting the 20% down mark and avoiding PMI is high.

If home equity loans happen to fall below your student loan rates and there is enough equity in your house to pay them off you can then take a home equity loan at the lower rate.

The bank you work with for your mortgage can certainly help you with understanding using your equity that’s in your house. What you do with it you should be protected.

FinancialPlanning,How to combine finances when married,Pretty-Date1630,"I think that how you handle the accounts is a secondary issue.  A lot of people start there, but that's really just an administrative choice.  The first thing that you want to do is put together a financial plan and a budget.  That way, you are on the same financial page and working toward the same goals.  In a lot of relationships, people don't have these conversations and they end up working at cross purposes, which causes conflict and frustration.  But if you can get on the same page about financial goals and create a good budget, then you will set yourselves up for financial success.  Once you have that, how you manage your accounts is really just personal preference.  

To start, I would talk about future goals - what do you want your life to look like?  Then set some goals to get you there.  You may want to buy a house, have kids, travel extensively, retire early, start a business, invest in real estate and become landlords, take a job in a lower-paying field that is more fulfilling... Once you figure out together where you are going, you can figure out what you need to do to get from where you are now to where you want to be.  You may not be able to do all the things on your list at the same time, so you'll prioritize.  

So for example, if you decide that you priority is to buy a house, you'll need to clear that debt in collections, rebuild your credit, pay off other debt, and save for a down payment.  You probably can't do all of that at once, so you'll need to do it in steps - and while you are in school, your progress will likely be slower, but then speed up once you are done and working in your field.  Typically people tackle the debt first, then save.  Voila! You've got part of your plan established.  

Next, put a budget together.  Lay out your combined income and basic expenses - housing, transportation, utilities, insurance, food, etc. Take a hard look at those expenses and see if there is any place to cut spending.  Like, you may want to shop around for car insurance to see if you are getting the best rates.  Or if you buy lunch out a lot, bring lunch from home a couple days per week.  This stuff adds up.  Then figure out how to allocate the rest of your income to get you to your goals - debt, savings, discretionary spending, etc.  

Once you have the budget, then figure out how to pay the expenses - which was your original question.  Do you want to pool all of your income into joint accounts or have separate accounts? If joint, decide who will be primarily responsible for managing the accounts and paying the bills.   If separate, then you will decide who will pay which expenses out of which accounts.  There are a lot of ways to put it together and it doesn't really matter how you do it as long as it works for you.  Having a common financial plan and budget is really the key.",Shot-Artichoke-4106

FinancialPlanning,How to combine finances when married,Pretty-Date1630,"What works great for my wife and I, and what feels to me to be the most fair, is to determine what percentage of your total income each of you makes. Then use that percentage to determine how much of your shared expenses each of you will pay. Your savings and retirement stay yours until they are used for shared expenses.

So for example:

\-You bring in $1,000 per month after taxes, and your fiance brings in $3,000 per month after taxes. This means you both bring in a total of $4,000 per month.

\-Your share of that total is 25% ($1,000 / $4,000) and your fiance's share is 75% ($3,000 / $4,000)

\-Make a list of your expenses for things you share (rent, groceries, subscription services, utilities, etc)

\-Total up the monthly cost of your shared expenses. 

\-Multiply the total expenses by 25% in order to get how much your share of the expenses should be, and multiply the total expenses by 75% in order to get your fiance's share.

\-For example, if your total shared expenses amount to $2,300, your share of that would be $575 (.25 x $2,300) and your fiance's share would be $1,725 (.75 x $2,300).

\-So that month, you contribute $575 and your fiance contributes $1,725.

It's hard to say for sure if you can afford it without knowing what an apartment by you costs. Some general guidance that may help:

Housing costs shouldn't take up more than 30ish percent of your income. 

Your income will be subject to somewhere in the ballpark of 20% taxes. So if partner's income is $14/hr x 40hr = $560/wk x 4.3 weeks in a month, then minus tax, their takehome will be ballpark $1900/mo. If you were to bring home the same, an apartment with utilities under $1200ish would be very doable. 

With low transportation and food costs, you could afford more for housing. Those three categories tend to be the biggest expenses, food, housing, transport. If you've got expensive car payments, high insurance costs, debt payments, etc, housing may need to be cheaper.

FinancialPlanning,Different S&P 500 share prices,Lawfulness_Nice,"I am sitting here trying to figure out how to explain this. I give up. Trust me, the index tracks performance of the 500 stocks.

But this is actually a very thoughtful question.",mcc1224
FinancialPlanning,Different S&P 500 share prices,Lawfulness_Nice,"If a company has a total of 100 shares of stock issued, and each share is worth $100, they can decide to do a stock split and then have 200 shares of stock issued, with each share being worth $50. If I had 5 shares at $100, then I would automatically have 10 shares at $50 after the split.

What you are describing is a slightly different but similar situation. Fidelity has their own ETF fund which tracks the S&P 500. Other companies (let's just use Vanguard as an example) also have ETF funds that track the S&P 500. The performance of these funds will essentially be identical, with the only significant difference being the expense ratio. Let's say for example the total amount of money in the S&P 500 ETF for fidelity is equal to 3% of the total S&P 500 and the total amount of money in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is equal to 6% of the total S&P 500. If both companies decide to have that issued as the same number of shares, then the Vanguard share price will be double that of the Fidelity one. 

Basically companies decide how many total shares they want to have and the price of each share balances out proportionally. The benefit of having a lower share price is that it is easier for people with less money to buy in and the benefit of having a higher share price is that doing option contracts that charge a fee per contract is cheaper with a higher share price.

TLDR: it doesn't matter what the price of an individual share of an ETF is, it just matters what the ETF tracks.",Berodur

FinancialPlanning,Need help on allocating savings/investments every month,99attfirstbtw,"First step is figuring out how much to have as an emergency savings, which should be kept mostly in a HYSA (you can keep a small portion in a brick n mortar bank for peace of mind). General guidance is 3-6 months of expenses so $8k - $16k for “if shit hits the fan”. If your single or dual income with no dependents and have an easily replaceable job if you were to lose it, lean towards 3 months and vice versa. 

For where to allocate Roth vs traditional retirement accounts, that comes down to your marginal tax bracket. If you’re less than 25% marginal tax, prioritize Roth. Check if your 401k has a Roth 401k option and follow the same guidance for the 6% match amount if so. Over 25% and you should go with traditional tax deferred accounts.

That way if things go sideways you know you’re ok for a full year. Your 401K will be taxed on distributions. Maxing out the employer match is all I would personally consider. I assume it’s not a Roth 401K and just from your net income is too far from lowering you down a tax bracket. I assume you are either in the 22% or 24% tax bracket and that two percent won’t make as much of a difference as the gains you will make from a Roth IRA over your lifetime. Maxing out a Roth IRA is the most beneficial. No taxes on distributions and no age requirement to take distributions but you can’t touch it until 59 1/2 or you are penalized.

I suggest you start by writing down a complete list of who you owe money to, with the amounts, what interest rates each creditor is charging and what the minimum payments are. This shows the scale of the problem. 

Also write down your income, what your basic living costs are, and what else you're spending the money on, ie your budget.

FinancialPlanning,Should I consider bankruptcy at age 26,category_7,The Orman rule was to consider BK if dischargeable debts approach annual income. A BK counselor can run the numbers for you. (Beware of biased counselors who are feeders for law firms.),peter303_
FinancialPlanning,Should I consider bankruptcy at age 26,category_7,"I'm not saying BK is a horrible idea, but once you've declared bankruptcy you can't take that back and you never know when you may regret it. That being said, BK laws exist for a reason, you just have to make sure you're in a good position moving forward otherwise you'll just be deeper in the hole.

Since your debt is only $22k, you're really not in that bad of a spot. But what is your plan for income? You need to have a way to support yourself moving forward before you can really evaluate whether or not bankruptcy is a good idea.

Its also important to get an idea of which debts you owe are *secured* vs. *unsecured*. Secured debt is debt tied to specific collateral, which is the majority of car loans. Unsecured debt is not tied to any collateral, and this is usually the case for credit card debt and certainly for medical bills. Student loan debt is also not dischargeable in bankruptcy so that's another factor.

The reason this is important is a few things. If you declare bk, you can count on losing any collateral that secures secured debt. But unsecured debt apart from student loans are effectively wiped away. Becuase of this, you are in a good position to negotiate with any unsecured creditors because the threat of bankruptcy means they lose everything. 

So if you have large amounts unsecured debt, talking directly to the creditor can be a good solution. They may agree to waive a lot of interest just to get you to make payments and get them paid before they lose everything.

You can also negotiate with a secured creditor, since the cost of foreclosing on collateral is signficant and often the value of the collateral is not enough to cover whats owed. If you need your car to earn money, you might find a lender who is willing to cut you some slack, but this is less likely than with an unsecured debt.

FinancialPlanning,Can I spend more on wants/needs because I'm way ahead on retirement?,R-3-D,"Well it depends what your goals for retirement are of course.  If you want to retire very early or if you want to have a very abundant retirement then save save save is the name of the game.  If you are content with retiring at a normal retirement age, say 65, and with a decent income that will cover your expenses then yes I would say having $515k at age 29 is enough and you can basically coast on that.  Even with no more contributions and a modest 5% average return that would grow to $3 million by age 65.  


I'd consider at least doing the contributions that will get you the major returns, filling out your upper bracket with pretax or getting employer matches.  If nothing else that will just help you retire that much earlier.

Deciding whether to have a child before owning a house is a personal choice that depends on your individual situation and priorities. Consider factors like your financial stability, long-term goals, the cost of housing in your area, career prospects, and your emotional readiness for parenthood. It's essential to have open discussions with your partner, if applicable, and align your decision with what matters most to you and your values. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and what works best varies from person to person.

You can always save more money, or cut your budget, or buy a smaller house, or rent while your children are young, but time is something you cannot get back. If parenthood is calling, listen. I'm not saying go get pregnant tomorrow, but maybe start setting reasonable goals for when you would feel comfortable starting.

We had our kids in mid 20s, it certainly wasn't ""perfect"" in terms of money, but it worked for us. My BIL (who is 6 years older than us) always talked about family but never got his act together.

FinancialPlanning,Having a kid before owning a house?,WombatKiddo,"The biological clock is more important because it is certain and the later you start:

* The greater the risk of fertility problems.
* The greater the risk of poor outcomes for mother and child.
* The greater the risk that grandparents may not be able to give much support and may need support at the same time as you are dealing with young kids.

Future house prices could be higher or lower so look at the possibilities and potential consequences.

* Interest rates are high compared to a rates available a few years ago but are far lower than they have been multiple times in current lifetimes. Lets say the possible range is 1% - 20%
* When the rates are low, people can borrow lots and competition drives prices up. When they are high, borrowing capacity is low, sellers have to compete for fewer buyers, and prices drop.
* If prices rise it will be a PITA but your earning capacity suggests you should still be fine. 
* If prices fall and you find yourselves having to sell you could find yourselves losing everything you have put into the house and possibly more.
* Its not long ago that house values in some parts of the US dropped by over 60% in just a few years

FinancialPlanning,Having a kid before owning a house?,WombatKiddo,"Heyo!

We waited to have kids until after professional training. Ended up very happy but also a few things I wish we knew earlier. 

1: pregnancy isn’t a smooth process for everyone. You may have miscarriages or other complications. These seem to occur less often if you’re younger. 

2: We worried that we’d be old parents, but while some of our peers had kids younger, at our day care were not even the oldest. Plenty of people have kids older. 

3: even though we waited, the economy didn’t really help us much. We wanted a house that 3 years ago would’ve been 600k. Now it’s 1.3 million. 

So the lesson I learned overall is have kids when you want them. Buy a house when you can afford it. You’ll probably never feel ready to have kids bc there’s always something else you could have done to prepare. House once you can afford it, you’re ok.",Backpack456

Things we thought about after kids: Location, School System: is Kindergarten half day or full? Do we pay for full day? Do they offer extended day care for working parents? Is there a fee for bussing? Are there fees for sports or after school programs? What is the reputation for special needs services?

Kids are as expensive as you allow them to be after their basic needs are met. Our rent was considerably lower than our mortgage/taxes/ins and that's not even adding in the basic upkeep when things fall apart and break. Renting also allowed us to be flexible when I wanted to stay home for a few years. There's no way that would've been possible had we owned at the time.

My wife's family was living in staff housing when she was born.  Dad got fired and found a house to rent.  they moved into a house shortly before I did...  in their case, it was inherited.

the money side is a problem either way.  My hint on baby stuff:  buy used - except for the car seat.  basinettes and cribs and changing tables and bouncy seats and bouncy chairs and high chairs don't wear out after one or two or even three kids.

what makes it difficult is moving when you have your kid.  or when you're pregnant with a kid.

And yes I think you can raise a child for $200-300 per month.

You have some one time expenses for a newborn (stroller, car seat, monitor, etc.), but many families will help with these. 

Recurring costs are basically diapers and wipes, baby food or formula (or breast milk which is very inexpensive, probably close to free), clothes, soap.

The only real wildcard is healthcare. Most health plans will cover the routine and preventative care for a child. BUT depending on what kind of plan you have, your insurance premiums can go up a lot. If you were on a self-plus-one plan and are moving to a family plan, that’s going to cost you.

FinancialPlanning,Having a kid before owning a house?,WombatKiddo,"That's because you aren't thinking about what caused the massive jump. In short there is a certain annual demand for housing, and when COVID happened and shut down construction and factories we massively impacted the production of houses. Add in the low interest rates and the moratoriums and the demand for housing skyrocketed.

Now the problem is that we actually haven't produced enough homes to get over the hump. I believe the US is short around 2.2m units. Which means that for the foreseeable future housing will always be in demand.

So I certainly understand your point that if you have cheap rent and you can invest along side it that's fine. Also since most people don't buy real estate as an investment (they think their house is but it really isn't) then I would agree to stay renting as the Interest, fees and maintance could easily equate to rent.

Roth 401(k):

Tax benefits—> Contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made after-tax, but your earnings grow tax-free and you can withdraw them tax-free in retirement. This can be a great option if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than you are now.
Contribution limits: The annual contribution limit for a Roth 401(k) in 2023 is $20,500 for people under age 50.
Investment options—> The investment options available in a Roth 401(k) plan are typically limited to those offered by your employer.
Early withdrawal penalties—> If you withdraw money from your Roth 401(k) before age 59½ and have not met the five-year rule, you may have to pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty and income taxes on the earnings portion of the withdrawal.

Brokerage account:

Tax benefits—> Contributions to a brokerage account are made with after-tax dollars, and your earnings are taxable when you sell them. However, you can offset your capital gains taxes by selling investments that have lost value.
Contribution limits—>There are no contribution limits for brokerage accounts.

FinancialPlanning,Should i take out a personal loan of $25k for a software boot camp?,Alrekt821,"I'll tell you a bit about my background-

I personally have done a bootcamp during 2021 and was able to luckily land a job during the peak of the tech boom. The job paid 100k/yr, but I was very, VERY lucky because I was able to get in right before the BIG tech fall.  


During my time at bootcamp I was luckily still living at home so my expenses weren't a lot and the bootcamp was actually free (funded by the state).

Personally taking out a loan that large is very, very risky because right now the tech space is at an all time low. Tech had an enormous boom from 2020 and it's bubble bursted at the end of 2022. There has been a big downfall in tech jobs due to over-hiring during the pandemic and the interest free loans tech companies were able to take out during the time.  


Also sorry to be intrusive, but I noticed in your recent post mentioning your friend recommending this bootcamp to you and her brother doing the same course and is working there now too. If she works for the bootcamp I would see it as a red flag.   
The bootcamp I was apart was proudly saying ""90%+ of our graduates found jobs after X months""; a lot of times they just hire those graduates to be instructors to pump up their numbers. I've seen this happen to quite a few different bootcamps..  


&#x200B;

If you do decide on going with the bootcamp I have a few advice for you

\- PLEASE be serious about it and work your butt of because it's about dedication and consistancy. You'll be bombarded with so much information your head will spin. I personally had 7 hour classes, but I spent an extra 4-5 hours after class everyday just diving into the material and getting a real understanding of it and also went above and beyond.  


\- You'll need to be a very extraverted and out-going person. Since you'll be at a big disadvantage with the experience/knowledge gap most employers would rather work with someone who's a bit inexperience, but hungry to learn and someone they vibe with rather than a know it all insufferable jerk. 

\- In my cohort I believe only 10%-20% people were able to get a job in the tech field. Everyone else pretty much wasted their time and went back to their old lives. The ones that got jobs were both technically skilled and very pleasant people to be around.  


I would highly recommend visiting  /r/cscareerquestions for more insight as most of the people there are green to the tech field;  albeit with more traditional CS degrees.   
Not to deter you, but it does get doom and gloom as there's people with several people with CS degrees and FAANG internship experience, but still not being able to land a job after 500+ applications.",PainterParticular385

FinancialPlanning,Does it matter which shares I sell?,TameImpalaFan69,"Yes it matters -- tax wise.

You will pay capital gains taxes on shares that you sell.  Capital gains taxes are computed based on the gain...  different ""lots"" of shares have different ""cost bases""...  so if you sell some ESPP shares bought Feburary 7th, they will have a different gain than a stock bonus vesting on February 15th.

If the stock has gone zoom-zoom, it's likely that there's not much difference between any of the lots...but look and understand the cost basis before you sell.

Also, understand whether they're considered short term (less than a year) or long term (held longer than a year after ***vesting****.*  Tax rates are higher for short term held shares sold.

The most important thing is to have a plan for handing the cash you get.  In my opinion, do not sell until you have that settled.

Personally, I've chosen to not participate in ESPP because of the ""bonus stock shares"" (RSUs) I get.  my holdings in company stock are again pushing my comfort level.

Does your company offer a 401k plan?  I suggest your current ESPP contributions to the 401k.",micha8st

1. Pay off all debt & loans --- So that leaves you with 109k

3. Allocate the rest for investment (investment could also relate to continued education or work-related training such as a coding boot camp). Set a range for Safe/Slight Risk/Higher Risk investments and what you are comfortable with.

* If you want to purchase stocks: it's a safer bet to stick with ETFs. In terms of how to purchase, I would purchase X amount each month at a maximum, maybe 10% of XYZ remaining cash goes in each month (so you'd spend it all in 10 months). You never know what the market will do, after all.
   * Of course, you don't need to stick to purely ETFs, especially because you're young and have room to hold --- you could do something like 75% ETFs/15% Large-caps/10% Growth-stocks. The point is, you get what I'm saying here. Decide what you're comfortable with.

\*If you do purchase Stocks, make sure you start gradually learning about it all. Learn about what a cash covered put/covered calls are before ever touching options.

OK, hopefully I have your attention. Paying off all your debt is terrible advice. Only pay off your high interest debt. If it's above 8%, pay it off. If it below 8%, keep making payments. 147K is no where close to changing your life. All it can do is set you up for a better retirement down the road.

Take every penny that is left after paying off only high interest debt and invest it. Talk to a financial adviser for advice on exactly how. At you age, your risk tolerance is high, so don't invest conservatively, that's for 50 year olds. 

You should be getting better than 8% return on your investments. That's why you shouldn't be paying off low interest debt. Because you can make more money by investing that same money than paying off the debt.

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"You should try to understand compounding interest first.

If you can put money into a savings account that makes 4% interest.  $10,000 becomes $10,400 in a year.  But I’d you have $10,000 in debt at 3% interest rate then the debt becomes $10,300 in a year.  

In the above example, it could make more sense to put the money into the savings account instead of paying off your debt because it will net you $100 more per year.

Same logic can be applied to investment portfolios.  For example you can generally expect an average of 7% YOY growth *over a long period of time* [this is an average— you can’t expect this in a single given year]. 

There are more personal factors based on your own personal goals about where to put the money but you should make sure you understand this basic principle before making a decision.

I also *highly* recommend putting the money into a semi liquid account like a HYSA or CD for just 12 months until you figure out what you should do.  Main reason is you this is a one time payment you received and you should get used to seeing it in your account — any amount you take out of it is not coming back because it wasn’t part of any recurring payments you get.

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,I always wondered how some people get such large settlements from car accidents. What was the scenario?,OneForMany
FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"can i ask the interest rates on the student loans and car loan? 

Do you like your car? I would look and see how much you could get if you sold it, and you could buy a reliable one (assuming you don’t have one), or hybrid which would save you on gas! Totally optional obviously

If below 4.5%:
-open two (or one if the other is above 5%) high yield savings accounts (u can get 5% if you shop around), put 8k in one, and 11k in the other, and set up automatic bill pay. Your interest on the HYSA will be greater than your interest, so you will be ‘making money’. Wont be a lot but you don’t have to look at the bank account and you don’t have to look at the loans

If above 4.5%:
-Pay off both. Now. Make sure you get it IN WRITING/EMAIL that you paid the full amount. Treat yourself to a massage or something that will make you happy.

When you are done with that you will have roughly $128k left.

1. What are your monthly bills? Look at your spending (rent, groceries, gas, insurance, going out to eat, etc) and multiply that by 6. Put this in a HYSA. I would recommend a different account than the ones for your loans (if you do open that), so that you can pretend those ones don’t exist

2. with what money you have left is yours. I would personally make another HYSA for cat expenses, and for car maintenance.

3. are there any big expenses you haven’t gotten? New mattress can change your life, new computer, membership to a gym or even a massage membership! 

4. Once all that is done i would recommend putting some of it into a retirement account, according to nerdwallet the median savings for ppl under 35 is $13,000. Let’s say you put in the max you can a year for 2 years, getting to $13000. If you do that by 25, and never put a single sent in, 40 years later at 65 you would have $135,000 (assuming 6% return). that would give you $250 a month if you lived to 95. Now say you could save $100 a month. You would have $389,000 for retirement, roughly $721 a month.

I would keep the car payment as it just helps your credit. And your student loans, I'd pay off a chunk and keep paying what you can afford monthly.

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"If you put 147k into an HYSA at 4.50%, then you'd get $540/month! Each and every month. 

If you keep it in there for 15 years, while also adding $100 to the fund each month, then you'll have $309k after 15 years. You'll be 37 by then and be much further along in life than anyone else. https://www.depositaccounts.com/tools/compound-interest-calculator.aspx. If you leave the interest earned and add $300/month, then you'll have $360k after 15 years of investing. Best thing about this is you can use the $500 here and there throughout the years if you need a repair, new tires, or whatever you feel is responsible.

Do not blow it on a stupid car. Do not dump it into the debt or student loan. Compound interest will gain you so much more after 5-10 years than anything else you do. Use the $500/month to put to the loans but go through the HYSA first.

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"147k is not life changing money, but it can change your life, if that makes sense? Like, you're not retiring early with this. But you can definitely make life a great deal easier for yourself. 

Almost none of this money should go toward anything ""fun"", spending it like an old person now will allow you to do way more fun shit in the future.

Before you pay off your debt consider the interest rates. It may be worth paying these off if the rates are crazy high and it will for sure be a huge load off your mind, but if the rates are like 2% and 4% you're going to be better off paying them down gradually and instead investing the money you would have used to pay them off into something like a fund that tracks the S&P500 or the total market and then letting it sit for 40 years.

If you've yet to pay taxes on it you may be able to contribute (some of) it to any existing 401k you've got going, up to the yearly limit (like 22k or something). 

And finally you may want to keep some of it liquid to serve as a downpayment on a house (though now might not be the time), as having money for a downpayment is almost always the big obstacle to getting into a house these days.

If you are going to get legit help on this from a professional (probably wise), make sure that the person you use is a ""fiduciary"" who is legally obligated to put their interests before your own.

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"Part of the trick to paying off debt is to not get back into debt. (This is excluding car and student loans) if the other debt you mentioned is credit card debt, take a long hard look at how you accrued it. Do you have an issue buying what you want without considering what you can afford? Then perhaps look into therapy to deal with short term gratification and impulse control. Is your salary not enough for basic expenses? Work on your career progression, getting relevant certs if applicable, and strategic job hopping for nice salary jumps or angle for a promotion at current job. Back to credit cards, get into the mindset that you should never ever pay interest; pay off the balance each month. If you're struggling to have the self control, cancel the cards and go back to using debit. Related to this, if your debt is personal loans, get into the mindset that you should save up cash for what you want. If you don't have the money now, you can't afford it now. Solidify that perspective.

2 - pay off your debts.  If you were getting less, you'd maybe wanna pay off on part of it, but you will still have a TON left over

3 - maybe unpopular opinion idk, but give yourself a small amount for ""fun money"".  Maybe $5k or $10k.  Money you can blow on w/e you want.

Here is some very good advice overall: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics/",PeachCobbler666
FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"Don’t tell any friends or family members. Resist the urge to go out and splurge. Find a good financial advisor that will help you invest the money for your future. A 7% annualized return (which is a little less than what the S&P has returned over the last 20 years) compounded over the course of 10 years will roughly double your money in that time, in 20 years it should be roughly 4x the original amount, etc. . Starting off with a nice lump sum gives you the potential of being able to turn it into a serious chunk of change.

Investor.Gov has a compound interest calculator you can use if you want to check out how compounded returns work.

As for the debt you’re carrying, I’d only pay off the debt if the interest rate you’re paying is equal to or exceeds what you would earn if that money was invested and if you can afford your monthly payments from your income on a day to day basis.

One last piece of advice, run from any financial advisor that suggests that any kind of insurance product is a good investment for you, including but not limited to Universal Life Insurance, Universal Variable Life Insurance, Whole Life Insurance, Fixed Annuities, Variable Annuities, Indexed Annuities etc. these products are generally highly illiquid and are I’ll advised for someone so young. A good financial advisor can explain further.

You pay them for their time, only. You do not pay them a commission on gains (which gives them an incentive to put you only in financial vehicles that most benefit THEM).

If you want my advice, the vast majority of this should go into a retirement account and then forget about it for a few decades (except when you go to make regular contributions to the account over the course of your life). At age 22 *starting* with over $100k in your retirement account you will be able to retire young and wealthy. With that much time on your side, compound interest will bless you in unimaginable ways.

This is an opportunity to be a wealthy person. If you blow this all on debts, cars, vacations, and the like you will be poor again. I repeat, *you will be a wealthy person if you manage this correctly.*",anh86

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"I’m not a certified financial planner, my advice is what I would do in your situation and is geared towards and comes from a more rudimentary approach to investing while getting educated on other options. 

1. Determine if your debt interest rate is higher or lower than you can get from a CD/High Yield Savings Account/Money Market. If it is higher, pay it off first. If it is lower, pay the minimum each month and invest the rest in the bank account with higher interest.  You will bet the difference. So if your loan interest rate is 2% and your HYSA is 5%, you should net the 3% difference each month.  

 2. Then once the money is invested or used to pay down debt, use the rest to max out a roth IRA. This is an account to invest money tax free for retirement.  Common suggestions are to do it with vanguard or fidelity, and I suggest for now just investing in one of their lower fee target date funds.  They’re funds that are designed to diversify over time to match up with when you plan to retire. 

3. Then I would save the rest in one of the bank investments you researched for the first part. 

Optional 4th.  Take out a small amount saved from step 3 and go on a trip to another country. Maybe avoid France for now bc bedbugs though lol.  You’re young and experiences can be more valuable, but responsibly so haha.  But largely pretend you don’t have the money, keep it invested and max your Roth IRA each year for as long as possible, and figure out your other financial goals (down payment for a house? FIRE? Start a Family? Etc.) and use this money to give you a huge leg up on those goals.",unicorn8dragon

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"A few things: 

(1) Don’t tell anybody. Friends will ask, then get upset when you say no. 

(2) Pay off your debts. The student loans should be first and immediate, just clear them. I’d say if your car loan is a cheap payment (under $250) or you can easily make it working you can leave that but only if your interest rate is 3.5% or lower (for me 3.5% or lower is essentially borrowing for free on that low of an amount.) if it’s higher then just clear it. This is a “to each their own” thing. Personally $20k to be debt free is amazing and you still have $127k-ish to save. 

(3) Put it in a separate account and leave the debit card locked up. If you have easy access to it then you’ll spend it on frivolous things. 

(4) I’d lock $100k up and forget about it until the housing market dips. Use the other $27k to stay debt free. What I mean is, if your car breaks, use a few grand to fix the car, if you need to make a big purchase then use that $27k as a “loan” to yourself. Do the same thing with any school expenses. 

(5) At 22, $147k sounds like it’ll last forever but it won’t. Don’t yolo money on stocks if you don’t understand them, same with real estate or businesses. Don’t use it to fund ventures you wouldn’t think about before. 

(6) Keep living as you are now. Don’t buy a 50k car, or an expensive house. This money is opportunity, use it to open doors and seize opportunity’s you’re interested in and add to it. Before long if you keep saving and remain debt free, with a decent job you could have $200k easily in a few years. Wait for the right opportunity that you understand to come along that will put that $$$ to work for you, if you play your cards right you could be in a situation in 10-15 years where you don’t have to work crazy hours and can go buy that $90k Mustang GT500 without it hurting.",SiggySiggy69

You can also open an IRA if you don’t have a plan at work and max put your annual contribution. Probably go with Roth IRA as its a bit more flexible and gains are tax free.

Here is a fun exercise. With average long term returns on the overall market, your investment doubles about every 7 years. At 22, if you retire in 42 years you will be 64. Here is what that $100k saved will be:
Age 22 = $100k
Age 29 = $200k
Age 36 = $400k
Age 43 = $800k
Age 50 = $1.6 million
Age 57 = $3.2 million
Age 64 = $6.4 million

Now, that $6.4 million in todays dollars is closer to $2 million.

You then take out 4% annually to live off of and you are set and protect your principle. Will basically feel like a tax free $80k/yr income. Maybe social security as well if that is still around.

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"What is your interest on the car? May want to leave that alone if not hurting for money before the check. I AGREE WITH SPENDING A LITTLE ON YOURSELF BUT DO NOT DO THAT RIGHT AWAY, IT CAN BE A SLIPPERY SLOPE. After paying everything but car, I recommend speaking to your tax person, the injury portion of the settlement is not generally taxed but the other portions may be. Having that knowledge right away can avoid headaches later.

Invest 60-80%of after tax amount into a simple savings plan, I always recommend CD ladders. I.e. 4 CDs each for a year so that one is maturing each quarter. 4% on a 1 year CD of 5,000 is approx 5200 at maturity, keep rolling them over unless you need them and one day when you get a 6k hit you'll be thanking yourself. I also recommend cash savings, mutual funds, etc... 

Do not increase your monthly obligations. If you make 1k a month before, increasing your monthly obligations by another 1k will cost you 12k a year just to live. Or less than ~10 years after you pay taxes. Which sounds like a long time until you're out of money.

A house is always a good option, 140k is a good way to get our of the renting trap.

Just a eeminder that this is a substantial amount of cash. A capital one account will generate a little more than 4% I think which is about $500 a month in interest. Even just using that interest income to pay your obligations is a good idea.",Hot_Towel894

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"I have to disagree with some of the advice here and say that you should invest some of it into real estate instead of all into an S&P500. 

Everyone is scared of the market, that it can go up, down, or sideways in the next few years - but no one has a crystal ball.

I think it’s worth it to buy now. Yes interest rates are high, but you can always refinance. When interest rates go back down buyer demand will come back up and everyone will be overbidding and fighting for housing again like 2020-2021. Right now buyer demand is low so sellers are giving huge discounts and credits to buyers that you can use to buy down your interest rate or negotiate costly repairs.

I just turned 22 and bought two homes last year, one as a primary and one that’s a rental. One was at 3.75% interest and one at 6% interest. Rates are even higher now, but just for context and that I practice what I preach. You’re in a position to do it too! Buy a cheap starter home that you will turn into your first rental and buy another house in a year or two for your primary residence.

DEFINITELY don't tell a potential partner until you're absolutely sure you're spending your life with them. Maybe not even until you start to think about actually retiring, or running into those future medical issues.

Have a nice holiday.
Pay/set aside for the deposit for your next flat if that's an issue. Don't go more expensive than you can afford month to month on your current salary.

Do any work needed on your car, maybe trade it for a better one, but not much of an upgrade, I'd only really consider this if you are driving a junker.

Buy a really good mattress, sofa and shoes. These 3 things are where you spend >90% of your time, and contribute to a staggering proportion of medical issues. If you work from home, include an ergonomic chair, keyboard and mouse, and anything else your setup needs. Light a bit sub par, buy a lamp. Maybe a bigger monitor, or two. Consider keyboard and mouse for the office if you work there. If work ask, a friend's parent just got diagnosed with some issues and you want to make sure that isn't you in 20 years.

A couple of grand's worth of other fun stuff, spread out over the next 2 years so friends don't think anything is out of the ordinary.

Check out [vanguard.com](https://vanguard.com). Website has a lot going on but it's actually nice once you get used to it.  You can set up a brokerage account with them, and they have a lot of funds you can drop your money in that are designed for people that don't know a lot about investing.  For example, they have target retirement 2060, which is a mutual fund for people who want to retire in 2060, and it's got the whole US & foreign stock markets in it (index funds), and bonds.  You don't pick the stocks, you just put your money in the fund, and there is a fund manager that adjusts it over the years to match what you need.  So now, it's pretty aggressive, but as you get close to 2060, it will get less aggressive.  The fees for it are really low, you can compare to schwab or fidelity, but vanguard is super cheap.  Set it to re-invest and you won't pay tax on it until there's a withdrawal.

Ignore anyone that tells you to buy a combination life insurance/investment, and ignore anyone that tells you that you need to pay a commission to a financial planner.  Just get a brokerage and set it and leave it there.

FinancialPlanning,Settlement from car accident just changed my life.,LucidBear21,"I  AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR SO JUST MY ADVICE. I am following my own advice below.

1) Pay off your debt.

2) Determine your monthly expenses for the year for an emergency fund. 

3) I agree with some people in here to invest in mutual funds or index funds.

4) If you have a high paying job already working from home, I would look into house hacking 3 units with FHA loans or low down payment loans while you stay in a unit for year. You can hire and negotiate with a property good management company that will take a cut but at least you don’t gotta deal with tenants till they call you for approval. After that year or loan requirements to stay in the place, take out the equity and get another one  while renting more units. Rise n repeat. Try to find good areas that you can charge a good rent that will pay the mortgage and will cash flow you when you move out. At this point you will have investing in real estate and the stock market. 

5) It would probably good to meet with a reputable financial advisor for some advice to verify your plans going forward.

6) You could also buy land and flip it which is easier than real estate investing or flipping. The buyer gets what he sees.",MitchellMD

FinancialPlanning,Receiving ~100k inheritance. Any way this can set me up for life?,ilovethelionking,"Firstly, condolences for your loss. It's thoughtful to consider how to make the most of this inheritance. At your age, with the right investment strategies, this amount can indeed set a strong foundation for your future.  
Power of Compound Interest: The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow. Given your age, if you were to invest the entirety of $100k and achieve a conservative annual return of 7%, by the time you're 66, you'd have over $1.5 million without any additional contributions.  
Diversified Portfolio: One key principle of investing is diversification. Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and perhaps some real estate. Index funds or ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) can be a great start due to their inherent diversification and historically decent returns.  
Retirement Accounts: Max out contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like a Roth IRA or 401(k), if available. The tax benefits will optimize your growth over the long run.  
Emergency Fund: Before investing, ensure you have an emergency fund covering 6-12 months of expenses. This ensures that in times of need, you won't have to liquidate investments, especially when the market might be down.  
Seek Professional Advice: It might be worthwhile to consult with a financial advisor. They can help tailor an investment strategy to your personal goals and risk tolerance.  
Continue Educating Yourself: Investment isn't static; markets change, and new opportunities emerge. Regularly reading up on financial news and investment strategies can be beneficial.  
Avoid Lifestyle Inflation: One trap many fall into after receiving a windfall is drastically increasing their standard of living. While it's okay to treat yourself, being prudent now can lead to a more comfortable future.  
To directly answer your question: while the inheritance alone, when invested wisely, may not entirely ""cover"" your retirement (given inflation and future unknowns), it can substantially alleviate future financial burdens. It's all about making your money work for you. By pairing this inheritance with smart financial habits, you're setting yourself up for a more secure financial future.  
Best wishes as you navigate this journey!",27Aces

FinancialPlanning,Receiving ~100k inheritance. Any way this can set me up for life?,ilovethelionking,"If this were me, I would do the following:

You are young. Take the amount of risk you are comfortable in and invest the money. Use this as a backstop to ensure you fully fund your 401k and/or IRA EVERY YEAR. If you habe to take $ out to invest in tax advantaged accounts, I would be OK with it.

TalkingRealMoney dot com (great podcast, BTW) has a quiz you can take to determine the level of risk you are OK with and will give you a target % of stock. It's called the risquiz. With that number, you will have a pretty accurate idea of what you should do.

Again, if it were me here's what I would do:

If 100% stock: VT or AVGE

If 60% stock: Vanguard Balanced Fund

Use some basic algebra to divide between the 2 if the % of stock is somewhere in between. 

Then the question is when to invest the inheritance. Percentages say that the greatest return is investing in a lump sum. You can lower the risk of buying in at a high with dollar cost averaging. Again, if it were me, I would invest 20%/year in the stock/balanced mix and put the rest in CDs. 20% of the balance for 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

2. Max out your 401k contributions and invest in index funds offered in the 401k plan.

3. Retain enough in the HYSA such that you never go into debt.

Invest what you can in an IRA annually. Max out any 401(k)s. Another poster suggested using the cash to max out the 401(k), but often you are limited to a percentage of your pay.

Keep 50k in your hysa, put the other 50k into a taxable brokerage account. Use the 50k to fund both roth ira and 401k fully. Thats a combined 29k per year for 2023, likely 30k for 2024.

You can contribute to the roth ira up till taxes are due the following year. So for eg. You can invest money in 2024 up till about april 15th, for the tax year 2023. 

I usually just dump the max in on the first business day of the new year in January for the roth ira. After that, i set my (roth) 401k contributions to 100% of my paycheck and live off the money in my savings. There are things to be aware of such as not receiving the full employer match when doing this but inquire with your own employer.

This has a two fold benefit though. 1, you fully max that 401k ASAP each year, and 2, it means you have no income and just watch your savings/checking account balances go down. This causes you to be frugal and spend less on unnecessary stuff. Easier to splurge when you know you have another check coming in 2 weeks.

FinancialPlanning,How can I buy a car independently at 22?,Subject_You3151,"Might not be a bad idea to find one private party or at a dealer and then get the loan and terms you want.  It'll require some digging to find what you want at a less scummy dealer, but shouldn't be too hard.  If you trade your current car in instead of buying the car on financing you'll also get a break on taxes (you don't pay tax on a trade in's value) which depending upon where you live could mean nothing or be a huge deal.  Between that and interest rates it might be worth exploring both of those options.

Loan rates on used cars are a bit insane right now, and if you already have a car to sell I'd probably try to avoid financing in the current environment unless you can lock in the rate you want from a bank or credit union.",gablemancer
FinancialPlanning,How can I buy a car independently at 22?,Subject_You3151,"I’d stay away from Carvana by any means necessary. Like someone else mentioned, go to a credit union or a reputable bank your parents use. If you have a Costco membership then you can also use the Costco auto buying program.

The advantage of this: all financing is handled by the bank you went to directly with. No need to fuss with a salesman about monthly payments, rates, etc. The bank will give you the options based on your DTI ratio or how much you’re willing to put down as a down payment with a great rate. USAA, Navy Fed, PenFed, sometimes CapOne and StateFarm are good banks.

Another advantage, you avoid having your credit ran a ridiculous amount of times. Finance managers will send your info to all banks they think they’ll make the most money from. Slap additional fees, slap on add-ons that will prob not benefit you, and send you in your way with a loan about 7k over what you originally anticipated.

Go online and check your local dealers out. Schedule a test drive. Get an idea of the price and go to your bank of choice. Handle the contract with them. Once you’re settled on the car you want, come back with a check for them from the bank and it’s adios.

Why?  I mean financing might be a good idea if you can get a low enough interest rate but why are you going to finance it no matter what?  You have cash.

FinancialPlanning,"Advice on 2022 and 2023 backdoor Roth conversion, complicated by stupid rollover IRA",FuzzyWasACat,"> 1) Convert 2022 and 2023 IRA (27k) to Roth this year, wait till 2024 to transfer 18k rollover IRA to new employer which will free up my traditional IRA accounts and start backdoor Roth conversions in 2024

This won't work, you'll get hit with pro-rata taxation. 

Instead, once you start your next job see if you can do a reverse rollover of your Rollover IRA into that plan. Once that's done, then do your Backdoor Roth conversions and you'll have a clean slate going forward.

You'll have to pay ordinary income taxes on any growth that occurs in your Traditional IRAs. But it's still less than doing a Roth conversion on $18k.

Another option is to do the reverse rollover now, even though you're planning to leave your current job. I don't see any harm in doing that. Then you can do the Backdoor Roth conversions immediately in 2023.",plowt-kirn

There weren’t jobs, and I felt lucky to get the one I did (circa 2009). I could have perhaps held my money tighter, but I did want to live a little. I saved for years to get myself back into school. Bought a house first…but that was at the bottom of the market in 2012…so it’s different times. Continued to work and work, save and save. Looked for better jobs, but the most I made was $15.80. I saved 20k to have a comfortable cushion, and went back to school in 2017. With the higher income, I’m currently back in school again, and it took me less time to save for that 

My advice- Try to keep expenses low, try to deal with having roommates. First is to have a couple months in liquid assets for emergency funds. Look into higher interest  bank accounts, some online banks offer those. Or money market accounts. 
 I don’t feel like what you have now is something to put into stock investments, although you should start contributing to some kind of fund- $20 a paycheck does slowly add up.

I am 42 and my wife has terminal cancer so i soon will be a widow like you in a few months at best. I dont yet understand what you are going through but i soon will and i feel for you.  


We are lucky to have some life insurance and a nice home that is nearly paid for but we do have children so i have been doing a ton of research on what to do with the money to keep us going in the future without her and giving the best life I can to the kids (and myself) without her around.  


You will be able to draw a widowers pension from social security in 10 years so make sure you factor that in as it will help with expenses.

Take a deep breath. You'll have to be patient. I also lost my wife when I was 50. And I was also self employed. My wife didn't inherit anything and she left everything she had to her two kids (from first marriage). I got her pension benefit.

Tell the in-laws that you understand their feelings and then cut ties. Tell them not to call you when they need help. What they're doing is lousy, even if you don't have kids with your wife.

You're going to be in a lot of hurt for a year or two. I started to date after two years, not intending to get married again but looking for companionship. But here I am now, happily married for 20 years and recently retired with plenty of money. Life moves in strange ways.

Dividend ETFs: Dividend ETFs are baskets of dividend-paying stocks. This can be a good way to invest in dividend stocks without having to pick individual stocks.

FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"Sorry for how things have gone.  My only finance advice to you is to remember that you need to keep a significant portion of your assets available so that in the event of unexpected costs or several months when stock markets are down, you won't have to hurt your long term.  If you have to sell assets when the markets are down, it majorly hurts your long term finances, and when you live on your assets, you can't simply not eat and not pay your bills until the stock market recovers.  I'm young enough that it made sense for me to set up whole life insurance that I can lean against when I'm in retirement and have times where the market is down, but in your case, your best bet is to probably keep 6-18 months of cost of living as cash so that you can live off of it in times where selling of assets would be at a loss.  If you sell something at a 20% loss, it requires a 25% growth to make it up, and similarly if you sell at a 50% loss, it requires a 100% growth to make it back up, so don't let 6 months of bad stock market trim 10 years off your retirement fund because you had to cover expenses during bad times.",berthela

It’s sad that her family aren’t recognising the financial position you both had to put yourselves in to support them, but it’s all too common. I was a caregiver to my parents for 16 years, have been part of a few support groups sharing experiences, and often even those being cared for never understand or appreciate what has to go on hold to make this happen, and the impact it can have.

FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"That is an extremely tough blow. Like the others, my sympathies.

My advice is ignore dividends and just focus on building wealth. You don't spend dividends; you spend cash. These days you can convert ETFs into cash almost instantly. 

What's better? A stock that returns 10% and pays a 1.5% dividend (VTI) or a stock that returns 8% with a 4% dividend? If you need the cash, you just sell shares equivalent to the 4% (less the 1.5% dividend).

Qualified dividends and long term capital gains are essentially taxed the same, and at lower rates than ordinary income, so when you sell the shares, there's no difference between the two. Having the lower yielding shares is FAR better during the years where you don't need the income.

In short, the lower yielding choice builds additional value quicker at a lower tax burden.

My recommended ratio is 70% VTI / 30% VXUS, but you can use VT instead (60/40 ratio).

Don't chase dividends. Focus on total return, and VTI/VXUS is the simplest best choice to achieve that.",Sagelllini

I ‘get’ the idea of divvy’s setup to provide you income. However they can also be a bad income tax drag. If you do them in your Roth, they are earnings that you can’t get to pre 59.

FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"I am very sorry for your loss. How devastating. 

Consider two buckets - the immediate use/ emergency bucket, and the retirement bucket. You can get lots of tax advantage by contributing to retirement accounts, so preferentially invest in those (you can withdraw starting at age 59.5, and earlier in some cases).  Within your retirement funds, the standard advice would be to invest in a target date fund for the year you turn 70. This will be a mix of stocks and bonds/ cash, moving slowly out of stocks as the years progress, to reduce your risk. Save most of your money in retirement accounts. You can set up a self employed IRA if necessary. 

For your non retirement accounts, you say you want 2 years of savings. That’s reasonable if that’s what you want. You could keep, say, 9 months in a high yield savings account, and the rest in short term bonds. Or iBonds (government bonds that you can sell any time after you’ve held them for 1 year, or you can hold them

Your integrity is shining through in you still trying your best to help your in-laws.

To others, let this be a cautionary tale to put a plan in writing and ensure living will and wills are updated to reflect that your sacrifices will be addressed.

If anyone is sacrificing by moving cross country, giving up a thriving career, changing jobs or careers to move-in and help out ailing in-laws. You need to consider how your contributions and sacrifices will be compensated.

Simply changing jobs has impacts on; seniority, the number of paid days off, having to re-estiblish yourself as someone who has talents and skills, someone who is dependable and trustworthy, etc. This could take years.

There could be a pay cut or increase in living expenses to consider.

Changes in schedules to fit in in-laws doctor appointments.

What about contributions to the maintenance (yard maintenance, etc), upkeep, and any upgrades done by you to your in-laws home?

It is such a crappy thing to do, I don’t understand people. 

However, I would encourage you to fund a traditional IRA. Pay the taxes later, as you will likely make less in retirement than you will working, unless you take significant deductions now. (Hopefully you will be able to put more time into your business not and grow it!) HSA’s are a good option if you qualify. You can kind of use it as a second IRA.

FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"Roth makes sense if you are in the lower tax brackets, it's a toss up in the 20s brackets depending on your tax bracket in the future, and you should be investing in a solo 401k / SEP IRA (not Roth) for higher income. I suspect being self employed your taxes are higher now than they will be in retirement.

Dividend stocks are just a type of company that doesn't have a good use case for extra profits. You should not see them as dependable income. You'll make out better by selling the S&P500 as needed, you'll pay less in taxes and you'll have better growth. Taxes only matter on taxable accounts but total returns matters no matter what.

FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"Very sorry about your loss...just to keep it succinct as you've already gotten a lot of advice: check out /r/bogleheads and even some of the various FIRE subreddits like /r/coastFI. General consensus is to put a 60/40 mix of some total market/international index and bond (i.e. VT or VTSAX and BND). I am slightly younger than you but a similar financial background, so I do value stock picks and indexes in my equities account, and any ""safe"" retirement accounts like 401ks I do the 60/40 mix.

The consensus I've seen is there's no real advantage to picking for dividends specifically but ultimately determining your safe withdrawal rate (around 4%) pitted against your anticipated monthly expenses. Then it's just a matter of liquidating some assets or disabling automatic dividend reinvestment to get the liquid you need for expenses.

Hope that makes sense...good luck out there ♥",fangisland
FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"I’m sorry for your loss. I’m also disappointed they transferred everything to BIL. How long were you two married. It sounds. It suspect that they changed the trust. Get yourself over Fidelity Investments. Speak to a Financial Advisor(FA). You can keep your individual investment  account  and make your swing trades there and learn to invest like a pro. An FA advisor at Fidelity will help you manage your Roth 401k and you can start trying to max your allotment. I’m 57 and max is $7k a year. You will get through this. Living alone gives you the opportunity to live as frugal as you wish and concentrate on your end game. If you don’t have a Life Insurance policy look into one that will cover your burial needs.

FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"Hey man, we all gotta play the hand we have been dealt. Yeah it sucks but she has been fighting this for over 3 years and its finally coming to the end we all knew it would sadly. While i hate your loss happened so fast sometimes i wish she had gone suddenly rather than us slowly watch her go from a fantastic woman into a shell of her former self that is now stuck on a bed all day unable to walk. There is no good way to go and no good way to deal with whats left behind.  


i have looked into SCHD some as it seems very solid in a Roth but i wouldn't try to go that route in a taxable account. I am looking for a little more growth but I will tell you what my plans are for the money.  


I will get a little over 300K but some of it is for the kids but i will handle it for them. I am taking 100K and putting it in USFR which is currently over 5%. 100K will pay off all the 3 notes i have but they are at 0% 3.5% and 2.99% so no point in paying them off when i can let it sit and make me more and use the payout to make the notes. If the rates go back down to nothing like they were a few years ago then i will just cashout and pay it all off.  


The other 200K i am still thinking hard on what to do. might throw it all in USFR for the time while i get my life in order or maybe just a total market index fund or sp500.  


Another option I had thought about is letting it sit making me 5.5%, or more if rates go up, and live off that and then i would be able to stuff my max into Roth and 401K during the year to get more into tax advantaged accounts. So many options and are long as its diverse funds you cant really go wrong. SCHD seems like it would be ok but i would get a huge tax drag from it.  


My company doesnt have a 401K but we will be starting one next year so that will be a new option for me which will really change things. Wife works for the local city government and had been planning on that nice pension but had be putting a little in a 457b but now that is no longer going to be an option. She is only 1 year away from being vested in it so we will miss out on that sadly.",Environmental-Pin848
FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"I see what you are saying, I’m thinking that you don’t need the dividends today, so picking a dividend fund is basically going to force some extra yearly taxes.

FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"If he planned on dying in 5-10 years, sure. The rest of us are planning 30+ year retirements.",Eltex
FinancialPlanning,Life just changed for me,Icy_Plane_890,"Sure thing.  When option contracts are bought or sold, they represent 100 shares of the underlying.  Say you have 100 shares of 100 shares in company ""ABC"".  ABC is currently trading at $50.50.  You could sell a November 17, 2023 call at strike price $55.00 for $100.

What that means is that you immediately receive $100 dollars for the call option contract and if left open\*, upon close of market on Nov 17, if ABC is trading at $55.00 or higher - you shares will be called away (100 shares per contract) meaning you will receive $55 per share (x100) = $5500 plus the $100 premium.   If the ABC trades below $55.00 at close of market on the 17th, you keep the shares and the $100 premium.  The contract expires worthless.

Now - if ABC is a company you are long on - if your shares got called away on Nov 17, you could then sell a $55 December 15 put for $120.  You would get the $120 immediately, and at close of market on Dec 15, if ABC is trading at $55.00 or lower, you will receive the 100 shares at $55 per share and keep the $120 premium.  If ABC closed higher than $55.00, you keep the premium and the contract expires worthless.  You get to sell another put on ABC for January or any other stock of your choosing.

\*Options contracts fluctuate with the market - many times if you sell a call or put option and the price of that option decreases - you can buy it back and close the position lower than what you sold it at and then resell later, or even recycle, pocketing the difference!

Hope that helps",concerto25

I believe if your AGI is under $100k you should be able to get $25,000 of rental losses against your income. If it's between 100-150k,  you should be able to write off some loss. Above 150k, I don't think so but may be able to carry some forward. Idk, however.

The emergency fund always takes precedence over retirement savings, and it sounds like you've got an emergency (or a series of things that adds up to an emergency). 

It won't be forever - it's just until you stabilize yourself financially, and then you can resume your retirement contributions again later, after you've replenished your emergency funds.

FinancialPlanning,"When should I start investing, how to invest and what to do?",Agreeable_Ad7380,"If you have debt, the answer is you should start investing yesterday. If you do have debt, then you should follow these general steps:

1. Pay off all minimum payments for debts
2. If you get an employer match for a 401k, contribute up to the max they will match (usually 100% or 50% match)
3. Pay off all high interest debt. If you can’t beat it with a high yield savings account, it has to go first.
4. Pay off low interest debt (around 4% or less) at minimum monthly and invest everything else. Start with tax advantaged accounts (Roth/traditional IRA or 401k) and then go to a taxable account. 
5. You should look at crypto as gambling, not investing. Be prepared to lose anything you put in, but you might not. 
6. Diversity is crucial. All financial theory shows that it is extremely difficult to beat the market consistently. Invest in something like an S&P 500 index fund and do NOT pay high fees for someone to manage your money. It’s almost never worth it

Without knowing your age and income bracket, it’s hard to give anything specific. Places like fidelity have some good target retirement funds that are more risky at the beginning and slowly move to “safer” assets as you get closer to your anticipated retirement date.",tleon21

FinancialPlanning,How much should I put as down payment on car?,Ok-Trouble8852,"The down payment amount won’t show on your credit history. Only the amount financed. This is what I would do if I was in your situation: find a place that offers 0% financing. If you can find one, set the full price of the cash you have to pay off the car in a separate HYSA. Your HYSA will accrue you some interest while paying off the car and building credit and you won’t be stuck paying hundreds per month in interest to the car. If you are unable to find 0%, or even less than 3%, buy the car in cash and instead open a credit card to start building your credit history. Use the credit card for your everyday purchases like gas, groceries, etc but don’t go wild with purchases you don’t need. The goal is to pay off the credit card statement IN FULL every month. Do not carry a balance from month to month or you will be stuck paying interest. As you pay off the balance every month, you will demonstrate to the creditor that you are responsible with debt which in turn the creditor  will begin raising your credit limit. This will start to increase your scores as your utilization rate stays low. Key takeaway - you don’t have to go into debt and pay interest to build a good credit score.",IntroductionCapital4

No it’s not naive. Going straight 401k is perfectly fine if it’s a good plan with low fees and good fund options, and you’ve positioned yourself to not need to raid a retirement account early. And you can always rollover your an IRA later whenever you leave this job.

FinancialPlanning,Gut check on my current investment strategy with Roth 401k?,Schmettywhop,"Okay. With your income in the 22% bracket, it’s not a terrible decision. As you get into the 24% and above brackets in the future, it will probably be beneficial to move into Traditional 401K instead. 

I’m not sure why you think your taxes would be higher in retirement. That is almost impossible. About the only way that happens is if you have a nice pension and work well past a normal retirement age. Most people, once they have enough saved for a comfortable and rewarding retirement, will actually retire instead of continuing to work. If you feel you will never retire and just keep trying to work into your 60’s and 70’s, then Roth 401K might make sense, as your goal is building wealth your your children’s inheritance, not your personal retirement. 

As for RMD’s, that should be the furthest thing from your mind if you are young. Almost every other year, politicians keep extending the age for RMD’s. It is possible there won’t even be an age by the time you retire. Also, even if the laws never change again, you will be 80+ years old before your RMD will hit 5% value. There are a ton of ways to minimize RMD concerns as you get closer to retirement.

FinancialPlanning,Gut check on my current investment strategy with Roth 401k?,Schmettywhop,"You might already be aware of this, I was unclear after reading your comment, but the comparison should be between your current top tax bracket (or the top two depending on your income) and your effective, or average tax rate in retirement. 

Working with your income in my state, a 401k would save you 22%, but in retirement you'd pay 16% in taxes if your income was still 83k and the tax brackets stayed the same. 

In comparison, with a Roth you'd be paying 22% tax on your contributions now, but saving on the 16% taxes in retirement.

So it does depend on whether taxes increase in the future, which is possible, maybe even probable. But generally speaking, a traditional 401k saves more on taxes unless your retirement income is significantly higher. Of course, a Roth has other benefits that a traditional 401k lacks.

If you have state taxes now but plan on retiring in a state with no state income tax, like Florida, a 401k is even more advantageous. Conversely, if you're in a state with no state income tax but plan on retiring in a state with state income tax, a Roth is a great option.",Parking_Fortune9523

It’s not that dangerous nor complicated, just be smart. Buying in our case is much better than throwing money at someone else’s mortgage renting, especially with the prices of rents in our area. Just talk about what you would do if you split up and put it in writing and get it notarized. 

Anyone else saying differently has trust issues or has been betrayed and hasn’t healed from their wounds and are projecting. You know the depth and quality of your relationship. It could be better and more trusting than most people’s marriages. 

I think you could make it work but you’re fun expenses will be tight. I like the idea of building a home someone suggested… you have enough cash to buy land… might be worth considering.

FinancialPlanning,"Buying a house, sanity check and does our math add up?",X1Viper,"I do not agree with the no buying except with a spouse comments. Buying with a girlfriend is fine if you've been together for a while and see yourselves together for a long time. But I do think it's too much house. It's just the 2 of you, so why do you want 3 bedrooms and such a bug garage?? You might think your jobs are safe but recent tech layoffs should make you reconsider. You should be able to afford the house just on one income, even if it's the higher one. 

You need to include home warranty into your calculations, the premiums vary a lot by location. And are you sure your utility estimates are accurate? Seems low. Your calculations also do not take into consideration savings for house maintenance. At least 2% of the house value should be saved annually for repairs.  If you get a 1.3M house that's $26k annually or at least $2k a month, which leaves you with $1k a month for each of your personal spending/saving. The $100k might not go as far as you think. Renovating a kitchen or a bathroom in a HCOL area will be at least $20k, new flooring will be at least $10k (and the bigger the house, the more expensive this is). You should look into how much different repairs cost in your area and plan accordingly. 

TLDR I think you will feel very house poor if you get a $1.3M house",auri2442

What if that person can't buy out the leaver's equity? Etc) I think if they get it all legal with a lawyer and are both on the same page then it's really no different than spouses buying together.

But the thing that gives me pause about them not being married is their vastly different contributions. She is 2xing him in down payment and in salary, so if they are 50/50 on the house and break up she might actually lose money while he gains it because she is putting so much more into it.  

I also think 2500 sqft is way too much to keep clean if you aren't having kids. In their case I'd invest more in retiring early.

The market value prices are extremely elevated because of massive influx of Tech over the past decades. If I ever decide to move there I would never buy existing, and build myself.

I am more comfortable about this because I'm an Architect and I know alot about real estate and renovation work. Most people think that custom houses are for the rich, but you can build a regular house and Architects as experts can guide you thru process of saving money with efficient design.

First step find land for sale, and when you find one keep a note about it. Google a bunch of architects and look at their project portfolio on their websites. Find ones that so houses similar to what you would want. Set up a meeting with a few of them to get a feel of their services and trust your instinct in selecting one.

Get them to look up the land you plan to buy making sure zoning will allow for residential build. Get quotes and lock in an architect. Get them to hire engineers and cost estimator.

FinancialPlanning,"401k vs brokerage account - if they perform the same, which one comes out on top?",nczp,"> If I put 10k in each one 

That's a flawed starting point and one of the most common mistakes I see when discussing this topic. In order to have 10k to put into a taxable account, you already paid taxes on it.   

If you have 10k of pre-tax income you want to invest and pay 26% taxes (my current situation), I can invest 10k into a 401k.   
If I put that money into a taxable account, I have to put in the post-tax amount of 7.4k.      

Do the math.  
Start with a pre-tax amount.   
Look at what happens if you put the money into a 401k vs taxable.   

For me: I have 10k to invest. 
Brokerage: I put in 7.4k, leave it to grow @ 6% real growth for 30 years, and have 42.5k gross, 41k net after taxes.   
401k: I put in 10k, have 57.4k gross, 48k net based on a high end estimate of taxes in retirement. My estimated tax rate in retirement is 16%.       
Same starting 10k, final result is an extra 73% growth on my starting balance.

A couple other things that push things in favor of 401k:   
* Better for tax drag, increasing return. Can be offset by high management fees.  
* Only withdrawals count as income, making it easier to control. Taxable dividends count as income, which can interfere with subsidies and taxes.   
* 401k have more protection from creditors.   
* May or may not count towards FAFSA.   

If you don't need the money in the near future, 401k generally beats brokerage.",ullric

FinancialPlanning,"401k vs brokerage account - if they perform the same, which one comes out on top?",nczp,"I oversimplified it partially out of laziness, partially to keep the comment moving. A longer answer:  

7.4k x 1.06 ^ 30 = 42.5k    
Really, it's 7.4k x 1.09 ^ 30 = 98k   

42.5 = real growth, or in 2023 dollars.   
98k = nominal value, or 2053 dollars.   

When we sell this 42.5k or 98k, we have 35k or 90k of growth.   

In retirement, I plan to have 100k gross spending.   
Not all of that will be taxable. Standard deduction, brokerage contributions, roth contribution and growth are all tax free.   
[Here is the federal LTCG, or long term capital gains tax rate](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/long-term-capital-gains-tax/#rates).   
Because my taxable income will be less than 80k as a married couple, I'll pay $0 in federal taxes on my capital gains.   

Each state varies.   
My state charges 4.5% on all growth beyond the contribution.   
On 35k of growth, that's $1,575. Rounded 42.5k - 1575 ~ 41k   
On 90k of growth, it's $4,050.

It gets messy if we want to work in future dollars or current dollars.  
1575 in 2023 dollars is 3822 in 2053 dollars.

Really all an FA is going to tell you is to either increase income or spend less money. Once you know where you may be overspending then you can get a grasp of where to cut therefore saving you more money for debt.

In terms of debt, I would research avalanche vs snowball method.

FinancialPlanning,26 year old with no retirement account,Savings-Ask2095,"The 6-8 month emergency fund in a High-Yield Savings Account is fundamental. If you don’t have access to an employer sponsored retirement plan, then fully funding you Roth IRA is also optimal. 

After fully funding an emergency fund and Roth IRA, you should then focus on investing into a typical brokerage account. You can do this at any command name institution; Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch, etc. keep in mind, this is not a “retirement account,” but instead, an “investment account.” Taxation rules will be different, but nonetheless, you’d be saving for your future. (Using compound growth).

People often overlook the importance of investing in both retirement accounts AND brokerage accounts for you future. Having both gives you a strategic advantage of planning in the future. 

With regard to the investment strategies of both your retirement account and investment account, a long-term growth approach is advisable. Therefore, investing in a hedge like Gold is not necessarily wise given your situation. In fact, I would personally not recommend you do this. Especially not physically gold. To make it easy for you, investing in ETFs and Index funds that track the general market would be best. For example, when you open your brokerage account, you can simply invest in VTI then set and forget. Please ensure you set up automatic investments so your deposit don’t just sit in Cash. 

For this to work, consistency is a must. Therefore, making and tracking a budget is essential.

All in all, it sounds like your doing perfect for your situation. Bummer that you don’t have access to a 401k. Make sure to open and invest into a brokerage account. And do not pursue an investment in physical gold.

FinancialPlanning,Are there any additional tax implications for cashing out a pension plan early than what is taken at withdrawal?,nothinngspecial,"That is a very good question. I'm not an accountant but I may be able to help.

State income taxes vary by state so I'll keep my comment limited to federal taxes.

If this was a cash payout from a defined benefit pension plan, then the IRS automatically withholds 20%, or $800 in your case. If you're under age 59 1/2 at the time of the payout without rolling it over into another qualified plan (IRA, other 401(k), which appears to be the case), then this $4,000 payout is subject to income tax AND a 10% penalty for early withdrawal. The effect of this depends on the details of your current tax situation. You can either figure out what the tax could be now and you'll need to include it in your tax return for the year you received the payout. In January, you should receive a 1099-R which will be sent to you and the IRS to make sure you include it.

If it's not too late, one alternative you may or may not have available is to open an IRA and rollover the payout into that IRA. You'd defer those income taxes until retirement and the 10% early withdrawal penalty wouldn't occur.

If it's too late to rollover that amount, paying off that 9% loan is sound. 9% is a hefty interest rate to pay, so if you're paying that for more than one year, it may be a good idea to use the money to pay that off. Then, the next highest rate loan (or even a long term variable rate loan) would be good to tackle.

Saving for retirement is hard enough when you contribute a hefty amount to your retirement. Taking away any of it whether by accident or on purpose makes it all the more harder. Don't sweat the $4k. It isn't going to make or break you. When looking at retirement needs, think millions (at least more than 1) rather than thousands unless you have an outstanding pension plan. The younger you are, the more valuable money is for your future though because investing well should earn you more than inflation over the long run.

I hope that helps. Good luck!",Striking_Monitor5101

Taxable Brokerage Account: If you've maximized your tax-advantaged retirement accounts, consider investing in a taxable brokerage account. ETFs and index funds are tax-efficient investment options. While you'll pay taxes on capital gains, the tax rates are generally lower for long-term investments. Holding investments for the long term (more than a year) qualifies you for the lower long-term capital gains tax rates.

Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Diversification can help spread risk and potentially enhance returns.

Look for funds with low turnover ratios, as frequent buying and selling within a fund can trigger capital gains taxes.

Tax loss harvesting is when you sell at a loss during a bear market, and then buy a similar fund, you can lock in the tax losses to offset future gains; you don't actually avoid tax, but you do delay it, and could theoretically time it so that you lock in the most gains during a year when you have no other income in retirement.

FinancialPlanning,"Despite my continued efforts, I keep messing everything up. What do?",WienerButtMagoo,"I think you are confused about what gives your portfolio value.  You are likely comparing the current market value and seeing it fluctuate day to day and month to month.  In short term, days, weeks, months, and even a few YEARS, the current dollar value can and will sometimes go down.  

BUT - and this is important- your total holdings don’t change.  If you purchased 10 shares at $100 per share, your dollar value at time of purchase is $1,000.  Next month, maybe the share price has dropped to $90 and the current value is only $900.  It looks like you “lost” 10% - down $100 in just one month.  But you still own the SAME 10 shares.  

Now pretend you ignore the fluctuations and just let your investment ride.  10 years from now, after LOTS of ups and downs, the share price is at $200.  Your current value is now $2,000.  You have doubled your money, plus the benefits of any dividends, etc.  

Now imagine you continuously invest $100 every week.  Some weeks this could buy you 1.3 shares, because the per-share price has dropped to $70.  You scored a 30% discount!  Some weeks, you may only get 0.75 shares because the price has gone up.  Investing continuously over the long term allows you to BENEFIT from market downturns and preserves the value of your shares so you can sell when the market is up -  hopefully long into the future.  Buying index funds helps strip the risk from individual stocks becoming permanent losers.  Historically, the market has gone up over the long term every time.  

People who were hit badly in 2008-2009 were only permanently impacted if the sold.  Anyone who rode it out has more than recovered.  

Investing is LONG TERM - decades.  If you have only been doing this since 2021 or 2022, that is MUCH too soon to be able to evaluate your returns.  All you are seeing is the “noise” that is natural in the market.",Trick-Read-3982

Yes, that's EXACTLY what you're supposed to do. I remember the time period you're talking about. Late 2022, right?

Maybe you have mismatched investment time horizons. You mention the cost of living, but your long term index fund investments, especially those in your Roth IRA, aren't there to fund your current living expenses. They're there to grow significantly faster than a HYSA over a long time horizon and pay for your living expenses far in the future.

If you're having trouble with your existing expenses, then what you need is more savings (in which case a HYSA is definitely the best option) or more income.

FinancialPlanning,Does this group agree with the 100 minus your age approach for allocation between stocks and bonds?,junger128,"So I wrote a personal trinity-like retirement calculator.  Knows about fed and state income taxes, capital gains, my wife's and my income streams, expected SS, our investments, tax treatment of those investments, mortgages, our living expenses based on 15 yrs of accumulating that data, etc.  

I use it to plug in hypotheticals--what if I move to a no-income/no-cap gains tax state?  What if we bought a more expensive house?  etc.  One thing I can play around w/is stocks to bonds ratio, or STBR  (when I say STBR=80, I mean 80% in equities).  Run the simulator w/STBR=100.  Run the simulator w/STBR ratio = 90.  etc.  See which one gives the largest pile of money when we die.

OVer the last few years as I approach retirement, for some reason every year I run my simulator, it is recommending that I decrease my STBR (aka: more bonds).  Then I realized:  Oh--this is exactly what a bond tent is--the closer we get to retirement age, the higher our sequence of return risk, the more I need to have in bonds!  D'oh!

In any event, our recommended STBR is still only 90%, and plugging in 100-63 I get 37% should be in bonds (or VV, my STBR should be 63%).  Why are we different?  The answer is: Right now we're sitting on household net worth = 20X household income, = 40X our annual burn rate.  In my simulations, our annual withdrawal rate never gets over about 1.5%.  We're 'different' from the basic equation because we have a big war chest that allows us to weather longer economic downturns.

FinancialPlanning,401K has not grown in 5 years,dingdong18412,"I'm afraid you don't understand how the math works. 

Your account is affected by recent and past swings equally.

Let's say we start with $100. 

Scenario A: +10% gain each year for 3 years in a row, followed by losses of -10% for 3 years in a row.

Year 1 = $110
Year 2 = $121
Year 3 = $133.1
Year 4 = $119.79
Year 5 = $107.81
Year 6 = $97.03

Scenario B: similar, but we start with 3 years of -10% losses, followed by 3 years of +10% gain.

Year 1 = $90
Year 2 = $81
Year 3 = $72.9
Year 4 = $80.19
Year 5 = $88.21
Year 6 = $97.03

In your head you might wish your biggest percentage losses would happen in the past when your principal is smaller, but you have to realize that those percentages are all compounded. Pretend that initial $100 grows to $1500 when you retire in 40 years. Guess how much you would have had if you didn't lose 20% ($20 out of your $100) in the beginning like in your example? You would have had $1875! That initial loss of $20 should actually be thought of as a $375 loss in retirement.

In your example, the late 10% drop had much LESS impact than the 20% gain in the past, because 20% is obviously twice as much. Granted, we certainly would prefer to take market losses before we contribute additional money to our investments. But if the principal is untouched, it doesn't matter whether the 10% loss happens in the beginning and the 20% gain happens later or vice versa.",Parking_Fortune9523

I mean do the math yourself. Someone who has $5k sitting in the SP500 for 5 years will have vastly different return than someone who contributed their first $5k to the SP500 spread over that same 5 year period and slightly different than someone with $50k invested who contributed an extra $5k over that period.",Grevious47
FinancialPlanning,401K has not grown in 5 years,dingdong18412,"Right...unless...so it is possible. My point isnt that that is likely my point is we cannot really gauge the underperformance of his portfolio vs the SP500 without knowing his controbution schedule.

""It was volatile but still fantastic for investors who contributed equally each month.""

That entirely depends on the size of your contributions versus your total portfolio. If you are talking the last 5 years of a 25 year investment where contributions ate relatively small versus total portfolio size then yes. If we are talking 5 years of investment where you first started five years ago and contributions were the significant portion of your portfolio then no, because that would have put much more weight on recent performance so you would have averaged around 3%.

Here Ill take actual numbers from the last 5 full reported years and show you. This is using the actual SP500 annual returns over 5 years and starting regular investment 5 years ago lets say into a Roth

So the returns are as follows.

2018 -6.24%
2019 28.88%
2020 16.26%
2021 26.89%
2022 -19.44%


Start with 6k Jan 1st 2018 and add 6k every year there after. 

2018 -6.24% return. $5,626 balance.

2019 plus $6k to $11,626 then 28.88% return. $14,984 balance.

2020 plus $6k to $20,984 then 16.26% return. $24,396 balance.

2021 plus 6k to $30,396 then 26.89% return. $38,569 balance.

2022 plus 6k to $44,569 then -19.44% return. $35,904 balance.

Thats $5,904 gain over 5 years. Thats just a 3.67% annual return.

And thats with even contributions. If earlier contributions were smaller than later contributiond the average return would be lower. You wouldnt even have to go to the extreme of pennies.

My guess is its a mix, that OPs investment had a lot of its value from contributions over the last 5 years and it underperformed because its a weird mix of high risk small cap stock funds and low risk conservative bond funds with some redundancy sprinkled in.

People that complain don't understand the real estate market and the concept of being long term wealth.

Fundrise is an investing apps for accredited and non-accredited investors looking to make long-term investments in real estate and venture capital funds. The platform accepts clients regardless of annual income or net worth plus they currently pay up to $100 as of Oct 10th 2023 for creating an account

I think it's definitely worth checking out but each their own.

Just find a group that allows people to share referral links and referral codes so you don't lose out on that money for joining..

Hope this helps..

Best to you",Iam_motivated_jay
FinancialPlanning,Executive dysfunction and credit cards,fkinAMAZEBALLS,"I'm not trying to minimize what you're dealing with, but this executive dysfunction doesn't seem to apply to the one credit card that you've been successfully paying off in full to just buy basics, so why would it be any different for another card? Is it because of a higher credit limit that you feel differently about the other cards? Clearly you've been successful in paying off that one card every month. At the end of the day though, you need to get some help if you're that impulsive. But in answer to your question, it may make a temporary ding on your credit if you close old credit cards, but if you keep all your balances low and pay them off every month it will be fine and will bounce back eventually. The key here is paying them off and on time monthly.",ChibiChrista
FinancialPlanning,Executive dysfunction and credit cards,fkinAMAZEBALLS,"If you're worried you will fall into debt again, because a card is open, close it.  As long as you keep one card open, you will nor lose FICO points based on credit mix.  You may lose some points if closing your card causes utilization to increase. But utilization is easily manipulated and any points you lose from this will be regained as you pay your balances down.  Other than that, you will not lose FICO points.  Contrary to popular belief, closing a card will not impact Average Age of Accounts.  Cards closed in good standing remain on your credit reports for ten years, contributing to aging metrics the entire time.",AlfredHitchcock1899

Since you like diversification, there is a diversification principal that basically says the risk factor dies down when you diversify into 30+ options, the S&P500 is supposed to represent the top 500 companies, thus your risk is far less than investing directly into individual company stocks.

I grew up lower middle class and am a bit materialistic because we didn’t have much, my parents spent all our money on mine and my brothers education, but it gave us an insane work ethic. 

I’m an accountant and my view on investment isn’t orthodox. Invest in yourself and alternative investments that aren’t just about fiscal growth. 

Personally I say have a number you want liquid. Keep that in a bank. Mine is £100k. With whats left, including what comes in after, buy high quality versions of stuff you use every day, it does last longer and saves you money in the long run. E.g. we have nice cars. We enjoy them and if I needed to sell them, I wouldn’t lose any money on them. 1 of them also opens doors for me in business due to meet ups, invitationals and general attention. 

I also changed our wardrobe so it had sensible well made clothes. These also last longer. Buy your wife an expensive handbag. Its not just a bag. Buy yourself a nice watch, its not just a watch. I spent £7k on my dream watch and I won a client that has paid me over £60k over the years simply because we spoke about horology for 3 hours and the client felt they would want to call their accountant for once. 

Spend money on stuff that gives you time back. E.g. cleaners, laundry, gardeners. Spend money on levelling up yourself e.g. personal trainers, language lessons, new skills.

Give to charity and use some of that time you get back from the above to effect change in something you care about. I give to 5 charities per year and change these annually and actively give time to 2 of these and 1 other.

Play on the stock market. £10k. Its gambling after all but you’ll learn a lot. Then invest the rest in startups, funds, property and traditional investments that are purely fiscal. These are boring. But somewhere to put money. 

I guess my point is, you have a limited perspective and short term view of saving and financial growth. There are alternatives and growth comes in different forms. Your risk appetite seems extremely low and this can be for various reasons. But money is a tool. Try to see how you can use it.

FinancialPlanning,"22 Years old, nearly 100k in the bank. What do I do?",Throwaway_395820,"Real-estate. 

Invest in rental properties and start generating passive income. 

Advantage of the real estate market is you’ll have equity you can borrow against for future investments. And the money you borrow can’t be taxed because it’s debt. Example - owning a 200k house that generates income every year, let’s say 18k, and then you can borrow against your equity for an additional 250-300k at a fairly low interest rate because the money is already secured. 

The 2% interest rate on the loan would be far less than the 7-10% on income tax, and you’d be able to secure a second home and continue renting out and turning it into a 36-45k return in a few years if you continue investing your available savings into the property. 

The taxes on your earnings every year would infuriate me at that rate of income per year. 

Use the system to your advantage leverage your cash flow and make sure you do your homework before investing anything. 

Don’t panic sell when/if the market crashes. It always comes back. Normally stronger in 4-5yrs and you don’t need the money right then anyways.

FinancialPlanning,"22 Years old, nearly 100k in the bank. What do I do?",Throwaway_395820,"do not spend it on a trip to thailand.

what you want to do is get to the point where you have safe, passive income, which means large amounts of stock ownership (the people who work for the company work for you) or real estate (the renters work for you) or direct business ownership (the employees pay you).

So pick one of those 3.

I would pick stocks, because you can just get an etrade account and just buy something that has dividends, and bam, you're making money for doing nothing.  You can just buy 100 bucks worth of something cheap like American Airlines, and you get the dividends.  As long as it doesn't go to zero and you're getting dividends, you kind of can't lose.  As you learn what to buy and what has good dividends, the money will come in faster.  Don't put everything into stocks, they are volatile and can lose you money so just go slow and learn a lot.

You can do a rental property if you want, it's a little more risky though.

But definitely don't spend until you have passive income, and then only spend the money that comes from that passive income so you're not losing anything.

That's great that you have that dough, congratulations.

Remember there is a difference between saving and investing.  If you feel uncomfortable about investing you should research and learn so you can make an informed decision.  I would read the comments of this thread but I wouldn’t take it as gospel!!  My only advice is in order to help reduce your anxiety towards money set up percentages on where your money will go.  Example: I’m going to save 5%, invest 30%, bills 40%, fun 10% etc…each month then you have a structure of where your 💰💰goes. You come up with the percentages that work for both you and your wife.

If you want to be safe check out annuities. There are some that offer 7 - 8% interest based on stock market, but you will never loose the principle.

I think you have been very good at saving.  
However, is not a smart decision to keep all the money in the bank.  
It's fine to have some money in the bank for monthly bills and necessities.  
It's also good to have at least 6 months' worth of expenses saved in another account (but not locked) as an emergency account.  
However, I think that the remaining amount should be invested.  
Of course, don't invest everything in one single thing, but diversify in different assets.  
For example, I suggest investing some of the capital into stocks, specifically ETFs, for the long term.   
You can consider for example the S&P 500 ETF called SPY and the Nasdaq ETF called QQQ.  
This are just examples, you need a specific consultation, but if we want to keep it simple, every month start buying one or multiple ETFs and keep them for the long term.  
They will grow overtime.

FinancialPlanning,"22 Years old, nearly 100k in the bank. What do I do?",Throwaway_395820,"You should decide how much money you want to invest long term (3-5 year minimum) and how much you might need short term (car, house, emergency fund, etc.). Let’s say you set aside $15k to keep in emergency funds in a money market fund (extremely safe while generating great returns rn) which leaves you $85k to invest.

The first thing you should do is max out a Roth IRA. It’s a tax advantaged account that is outside of your employer. You can open one up yourself (e.g., just go on Schwab and click through the options, it takes 5 minutes) and move money into it. You can only contribute to a Roth IRA if you make under $153k (different rules if you file with your wife so look it up if so), and you can contribute $6.5k per year. So if you make under $153k, go open one and deposit $6.5k for 2023. Given how close we are to 2024, you should also probably set aside $6.5k to contribute on 1/1/24.

Then you should buy a very basic ETF - either S&P500 or Nasdaq tech index. S&P is more balanced, but lower historical return, while tech index is tech focused but has beaten the S&P by several % (which stacks up a lot over time). Because you’re young you should do tech (you have a longer investment horizon/can take more risk). QQQ is one of the standard ones you can invest in.

Then you should just dump the rest into a normal investment account, and do the same thing - either S&P or Nasdaq tech (would do tech again because in the long long run it has historically outperformed). Again, this assumes that this is money you will not touch/look at for years, and are okay with the daily swings that come with stock investing. Stocks are great because they’re very liquid so if you ever need to sell you can do so right away and they’re generally lower complexity than other assets (like real estate for example).

The last thing you should do is make sure you are maxing out a 401k with your employer. If your employer doesn’t offer this (small employers might not) then ignore this because it has to be through your employer. But if they do, you can contribute $22.5k/year directly from your paycheck, pre-tax. This is nice because it lowers your taxes in the current year. You will eventually pay tax when you withdraw it in retirement, but you’ll be making less money so hypothetically will pay less taxes by the time you withdraw. Note that again - you should only do this knowing that this is long term savings and you will not touch this money before retirement. Also, most employers match some employee contributions so you get free money from your employer as well. You can select which investment to invest in or automate it - I would just select whatever tech/Nasdaq tracking fund is available for the same reasons I said QQQ was good.",bumkin123

$100k in an HYSA earns say $5k a year but that counts as income so it gets taxed federally and state (if you have state income tax). That $5k becomes $3k.

Or you have $100k in a 401k or IRA and you are bring very conservative so you have it in a money market fund (which is similar it pays interest and no risk). Now you get $5k and dont pay tax on it. So next year that $5k grows by 5% etc etc.",Grevious47

For the longest time, I’ve have this mindset that I “just need to do (blank) ….” before I’ll feel OK spending money, where “(blank)” is something like, “I just need to buy a house, then I’ll be able to spend money without feeling guilty.” 

Obviously, this line of thought is somewhat irrational — spending $2,000 on a nice trip once a year won’t prevent me from eventually reaching my financial goals — and I’m trying to adopt a mindset closer to the one you’ve described, viewing money as a resource that I’m fortunate to have. It’s just difficult, in my experience, to change course and shift your mindset in such a way when you have this longstanding momentum of not spending much outside of necessities.

It sounds to me like the OP is struggling with this type of mindset, where they’re in an objectively good spot financially (I mean, a $100k net worth at 22 is really impressive), but can’t bring themselves to spend anything because they think they haven’t “earned the right” to do so, and perhaps think they can just put it off until they hit whatever financial milestone is most important to them.

Read as much as you can on financial literacy. Look at historical tax brackets. Estimate you future income. Estimate your retirement income, include inflation. It’s unlikely you’ll have a mortgage.

After thirty years, most people become self-insured.",glumpoodle

FinancialPlanning,I got this from New York Life,heathers1,"New York Life is a private company that's owned by what's called ""participating life insurance policyowners"", people who get to participate in its profit via annual dividends. Imagine if Chase would give you the profit it makes with your deposits/CDs instead of whatever it is that it gives you. 

Dividend-paying life insurance, which is what you would be converting to from term life, is practically a tax-advantage bond fund, primarily filled with long term corporate bonds, with returns also supplemented by profit from insurer's side businesses. You can expect compound corporate bond like returns (around 5%+) without having to pay tax that you can use like an online savings account. You are very unlikely to beat the returns doing your own ""bond portfolio"", especially due to tax advantage, not to mention the hassles and risks you'd be taking doing so. Best bonds in terms of yield are long-term and corporate, which institutions are better suited than individuals in doing to longevity and size of their portfolio.

Tax-free access is done through a practical wash loan as there should be little to no net cost for you to use the money. Ie: You give 5%, the insurer gives you 5%, IRS gets 0%.

Limited 5-10 pay is one where you only have to put money in for 5-10 years. The best is to put a lot of money within the shortest period of time. I don't know your retirement savings strategy but I'd personally put whatever money I would be putting in long term at bank/bonds into these, with at least 5+ years of living expenses by the time for retirement. Before retirement, you can use it as emergency fund and ""buy the dip"", which should push the ceiling on returns with long term tax free compound corporate bond rate being the floor. During retirement, use it to supplement income, especially during a bear market so you don't have to sell stocks when they are down big.

Depending on your age and health, it may be best to do it on an adult kid with you as the owner, as the net result would be a little higher due to younger age and health. You can use it like you own it, because you do, for 30+ years of retirement and then pass the ownership to your kid just in time for his retirement so he can have something that does nothing but grow around 5%+ tax free.",Linny911

>I am still stressing because once I am charged interest, two of my balances are above my credit limit.

That shouldn't happen. Credit card companies are required to charge a minimum payment that will *eventually* lead to a zero balance, assuming you don't spend any more money. That means that if your balance didn't start out over your credit limit then it shouldn't go above it afterwards, because even a minimum payment will push the balance down.

Pay off whatever you couldn't transfer if you maxed out on the transfer card.

FinancialPlanning,Need advice on how to pay down my debt please 🙏🏾,Fine_Present879,"“bankruptcy but can you file if your debt is less than your income“

Yes.

You. Am only get rid of unsecured debt like credit cards or overdue bills. It won’t get rid of mortgage, car loan, student loans.

Is it worth it for $50k? I know people who have gone thru bankruptcy for $7k because of medical bills and only  low social security for pension. So AMOUNT is relative. Is it worth it to you?

If you can pay it off in a few years, probably no.

But if you’re just paying minimums and the interest is gonna keep you in debt for a long time, yes.

The house you live in and 1 car is exempt also stuff like jewelry from being used to pay your bills, but other assets can be like some savings, recent inheritance can be confiscated.  If you have a lot of assets the court will work with you and come up with a payment plan.

You can get a cheap/free consult from a bankruptcy attorney- you don’t have to use attorney you talked to or any attorney as you can fill out the forms yourself - but if you have a lot of assets, having an attorney is best and they’re usually not to expensive.",Lostinmeta4

FinancialPlanning,looking for CFP or even advisor but new to this,Badmamjamma,"Disclaimer: my comment is coming from someone who doesn’t have or need a planner/advisor right now, but plans on navigating this problem in the future. 

I would interview potential advisors before signing with them.

For example if you want to prioritize saving for your kids college and giving them a better life, and the advisor says that’s reckless and stupid, then it’s probably a bad fit. Find those things out before you give them money.

Yes and no- it’s much easier to find a decent advisor by means of filtering for CFP’s. If you find an advisor through a referral and their approach matches yours and you mesh well, CFP may not matter. I know CFP’s that I wouldn’t trust my money with or agree with their approach. 

No

Yes- I would have meetings with anyone that you’re possibly going with. 

Your current advisor may not like it, but it’s happening whether is the same company or not. If they are in the same district, that may cause issues. 

Ask friends and family who they work with and if you know anyone that’s reasonably successful or in similar situation as you, I would ask them since you can get their “why”.",broken_tsi
FinancialPlanning,looking for CFP or even advisor but new to this,Badmamjamma,"As a fee based fiduciary planner and advisor, I will say no it doesn’t matter (just my opinion). CFP designation can definitely open doors, and have more built in trust when meeting with new potential clients. As long as the advisor is fee based, fiduciary, independent, and he’s not trying to sell you products for commission. You are hiring someone for advice, not for them to sell you stuff. 

Not a knock at anyone with a CFP. Anyone in the industry can tell you that having a CFP doesn’t mean that you are immediately a great advisor, just means that you took the course and paid for those letters behind your name because the CFP board ran some great marketing campaigns. I also know very good advisors with CFP designations.

I guess what I’m saying is don’t get an advisor just because he has the CFP, and don’t automatically disqualify someone that doesn’t have it.

Also, an advisor can be licensed in any state, so doesn’t really matter where they are located. Good luck!",VentiCupOfWater

FinancialPlanning,Buying and selling a house at the same time.,BatchWerks,"There are a few different options that can sometimes smooth out this kind of situation.

One would be a ""contingent on sale"" clause when buying the new house.  Basically you link the two closings so the buy doesn't close until after the sale, and the proceeds of that sale can flow into the purchase, allowing you to use that money as part of your down payment.  This does add complications, and can make you a less attractive buyer.  How likely a seller would be to agree to this depends on the overall housing market, interest they've been getting, and their own timing around moving.

Another could be a ""bridge loan"".  You get a short-term loan (perhaps through the same lender offering the new mortgage) that you can put towards the new purchase alongside the primary mortgage, letting you buy without first selling.  That loan then gets paid off from the profit from the later sale of your first home.  This unlinks the two transactions while still letting you leverage the equity in your old house towards purchasing the new.  

Or you can sell your current house and ""rent"" it from its new owners until you close on the new one and can move out.  This is more typical if you're not dealing with a long-distance relocation, maybe staying in the same city.  It's not clear whether that's what you're dealing with.  

I'm not really aware of any agreements around renting from the person you're buying from before actually purchasing, but I'd think anything could be negotiable.  Again, this would be something that they may not want to deal with and simply go with a different buyer with less complications.

Simplest would be to sell the old house and rent somewhere close to your new location until you find the house you want.  It's likely a higher cost (since you wouldn't be getting a long-term lease), but gives you the most flexibility along with full access to the profit from your home sale.",sciguyCO

FinancialPlanning,Buying and selling a house at the same time.,BatchWerks,"Options depend on your income. If you can easily afford two houses, your options open up. If you can only afford one, you're in a tough spot.  

You can do a contingent sale. You sell your property, put in a clause you have to be able to buy a house for the sale to go through. I'm not a fan of that in this market because finding a home in the new area and getting an accepted offer can be a tough timeline.

You can do a HELOC: open up a line of credit tied to your house. You could probably take out ~80k.   
You buy new house, use the money from the HELOC to buy the new one. Then sell old house. This requires being able to afford both.

You could buy the new house with a larger down payment.   
Sell the old house.   
Then recast the new mortgage. Recast = make a large principal payment, recalculate the monthly payment based on the new loan amount.   
This works if you can afford both homes.

FinancialPlanning,Surviving spouse (age 45) of an inherited IRA,SSRM17,"As a surviving spouse beneficiary **under age 59-1/2** my guidance is to retain the Inherited IRA for the full 10-year period in case there is any chance you’d need to take distributions from it. Doing so under an Inherited IRA would be without the 10% penalty. 

If you elect the Spousal Rollover option then you’re bound by all the individual ownership rules, including a 10% penalty for early distributions. 

You can still perform the Spousal Rollover option just prior to the end of the 10-year period, which avoids the full distribution requirement established under the SECURE Act.

FinancialPlanning,Surviving spouse (age 45) of an inherited IRA,SSRM17,"The only potential RMD I can think of is if your spouse had reached the age where they were taking their own RMDs from this IRA before they passed.  So only if they had turned 73 during / before this year.  If that's your situation, then I believe you'd have to first distribute their 2023 RMD (if it has not already been met) out of the IRA before then rolling over the rest.

As a spousal beneficiary, you can move the deceased's IRA balance into your own IRA, either a newly opened one or added to one you already had.  From that point on, that money is effectively identical to IRA money you put in normally, and RMDs only become a factor once you reach the necessary age in 30-ish years.

Oh, and RMDs only matters if you inherited a Traditional IRA.  Roth IRAs don't have those, whether a regular one or inherited.",sciguyCO

Thank you for your response. I was researching about SECURE ACT and the below article published by Fidelity puts things in a different perspective. I'm a surviving spouse referred as an eligible designated beneficiary does not have the 10-year payout rule and EDB can stretch payments over the EDB's lifetime.  Am I missing something here?

[https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/wealth-management/insights/iras-left-to-a-trust](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/wealth-management/insights/iras-left-to-a-trust)

&#x200B;

Eligible designated beneficiaries and exceptions to the ""new"" general rulesLike all general rules, there are some exceptions. Under the SECURE Act 1.0, if you are considered an EDB, the 10-year payout does not apply, and the EDB can stretch payments out over the EDB's lifetime, with some further exceptions. EDBs include surviving spouses, minor children of the original IRA owner (until the age of majority, which IRS proposed regulations define as 21), disabled or chronically ill individuals, and beneficiaries who are no more than 10 years younger than the original IRA owner.The stretch provision can also be used if the assets are held under a conduit trust for the surviving spouse's benefit, provided that the spouse is the only named beneficiary. Distributions can be stretched out over the spouse's lifetime, with RMDs beginning at the later of: 1) the year after the year of the owner's death; or 2) when the owner would have reached age 72. Upon the surviving spouse's death, the remaining beneficiaries are subject to a 10-year payout period.Keep in mind that the rules work differently if there are multiple trust beneficiaries. If all trust beneficiaries are EDBs, the life expectancy stretch payout is based on the oldest of the trust beneficiaries. If one of the trust beneficiaries is not an EDB, the RMD will be applied using the 10-year period, and if one of the beneficiaries is not an individual, the RMDs would be paid under the 5-year rule.",SSRM17

FinancialPlanning,Surviving spouse (age 45) of an inherited IRA,SSRM17,"Thank you! I inherited a traditional IRA and my spouse wasn't in the near 50's.Also,  I wanted to add that my spouse's traditional IRA fund had the beneficiary as our trust. It's a revocable trust where both of us are assigned trustees. I had to work with the financial institution and state department to waiver any taxation involved, being a surviving spouse( Class A). I'd like to use the fund during my retirement and I felt the best to do is roll over to my own IRA. Would this 2 step process trigger any taxation that I might be unaware of. The financial institute came back saying that since the assets had the beneficiary as a trust, I may have to liquidate within 5 years rule but I disagree with them being a surviving spouse, the rule is not applicable to me.  what are your thoughts and how do I approach this situation?",SSRM17
FinancialPlanning,Surviving spouse (age 45) of an inherited IRA,SSRM17,"Fidelity is not ""wrong"" and their **general** guidance is similar to what many others would provide, but it isn't comprehensive in nature.

Basically, what everyone is attempting to highlight is the SECURE Act dramatically changed the distribution landscape for non-EDBs, as they can no longer take lifetime 'stretch' distributions. But surviving spouse beneficiary as a special class of beneficiary that isn't bound by the 10-year rule. 

Sure, that is true...

BUT the links I shared try to convey that a surviving spouse beneficiary can take advantage of his/her unique situation by **optimizing** **how and when** to invoke their spousal rollover privileges.",HandyManPat
FinancialPlanning,Surviving spouse (age 45) of an inherited IRA,SSRM17,"Ok, so RMDs won't be a factor, so that's one less thing to worry about.

But the IRA beneficiary being a trust introduces some wrinkles, and those may not align with your expectations.  I'll start by saying that I'm not a financial professional, just someone interested in finances who's picked up some info along the way.  You getting legal advice or talking with an estate planner may be warranted.  Especially since different varieties of trusts may have different rules apply.

In general, a trust is its own legal entity that can own stuff or even ""inherit"" an account or other property. That stuff gets distributed to beneficiaries, done by trustee(s) following the direction of the trust's ""grantor"" (whoever initially set it up).  There obviously can be overlap among those roles.  You probably have filled all three: grantor by setting it up with your husband, trustee to manage it, and beneficiary to receive out of it.

But I think by naming the trust as the IRA's beneficiary, *you* didn't inherit an IRA, the trust did.  You being a trustee doesn't really change that, it just gives you the power to act as representative and execute the desires laid out in the trust documents.  Since the trust is not a spouse of the original IRA owner, this likely means it doesn't get the extra perks (like rolling the balance into a non-inherited IRA) that would've been available if the IRA had passed directly from your husband to you.

I feel its likely that this IRA, now owned by the trust, is subject to the same limited time to distribute the balance.  I know that's 10 years for an individual who inherits an IRA (at least if the original owner died after December 31, 2019).  But IRAs held in a trust may have different rules, I have seen mention of a 5 year distribution timeline for a ""non-see-through trust"".  That's just for the money to be removed from the IRA; I think the money can remain in the trust itself (making the trust responsible for the tax?) to be distributed to beneficiaries later.

So this setup may not have been ideal.  Things might have been easier if you had been the primary IRA beneficiary with the trust as contingent.  But given that we can't change the past, I don't think there's any way to get the inherited IRA's balance moved directly into your own IRA.  

Best I can think of is for the trust to take distributions out and pass that cash on to you as a beneficiary.  This unfortunately is taxable.  And that money cannot be put into your own IRA except by using it as a regular IRA contribution, which is subject to the $6500 per year limit.",sciguyCO

Option 2, buy a small apartment or condo and rent it out.  More risky, but possibly higher earnings.

FinancialPlanning,Almost $200k to my name. 45 years old. Self employed. Where do I stick $50k of it.,MyselfsAnxiety,"If your other option is something with basically no risk like a HYSA, then you’ll always be better off investing with a higher interest rate vs paying down a lower interest rate. 

Let’s say you have $100, and your choices are either pay down your 2.79% mortgage or put it into a 5% HYSA. If you put it in the HYSA instead of the mortgage, over a year that $100 will accrue $5 of interest, but you’ll only have to pay a marginal $2.79 of interest on your mortgage so you come out $2.21 ahead.

Then to continue that example based on your question, let’s say your mortgage rate goes up to 7% at the end of that year. At that point, since the rate is higher than what you’re getting in the savings account, you’d want to use the money to pay down the mortgage (assuming you still have an emergency fund etc etc). When you do that, if you had your money in the savings account for the last year, you’re able to pay down the mortgage by $102.21. But, if instead you’d put it into the mortgage, you’d have still only paid it down by $100. That’s why you’re always better off investing in something at a higher rate vs paying off debt at a lower rate (assuming your higher rate investment is risk-free like a savings account).",ijalajtheelephant

If when the time comes the best idea is refinancing then use the savings to pay off principal then. If that's the case you still earned more in interest in the interim that you would have saved by paying down on your mortgage.

Refinancing is simply a way to take advantage of the mortgage market's shift over time, done when the cost to borrow (the interest rate) is lower than it was when you first got the mortgage.  There are fees associated with refinancing (though smaller than what you paid when you bought the house), so those have to be factored in to figure your overall net savings.

It's not all-or-nothing, either; you can weight it in one direction or the other as much as you feel comfortable with.

The end goal should be to have both a paid-for home, and significant investment assets, by the time you retire. They are complementary - it's not one or the other.

FinancialPlanning,Where to long term invest besides a 401k,costco_execmember,"The gains have not been great for anyone this past year, though somewhat depends on what date you start from.  So the performance you're seeing is not necessarily a sign you're doing anything ""wrong"".

Diversification doesn't mean 401k + something else.  Diversification means buying different kinds of investments, regardless of what kind of account you're dealing with.  What kind of funds are your 401k contributions buying?  Did it default you to some sort of ""target date fund"" (getting common with many employer plans)?  That's generally a ""good enough"" starting point.  Did you pick a fund allocation yourself, and if so what (maybe post fund tickers)?  Is it (worst case scenario) sitting as plain cash and not invested in anything?  While that wouldn't fall from market downturns, it's also not going to grow at any meaningful rate.

A 401k offers a lot of advantages compared to a non-retirement account.  It just comes with strings attached like limitation on annual additions and when you're allowed to pull money out.

FinancialPlanning,Where to long term invest besides a 401k,costco_execmember,"It’s been a rough year for the stock market, but that is not uncommon. The S&P 500 does well overtime and averages like 8% I think annually? But that doesn’t mean that is 8% every single year. It is actually good while you are young to get contributions in at a lower price. The more you contribute the more the account will grow once the stock market starts improving.

It is like a rubber band. You contributing more is pulling the band back, and when the stock market starts shooting up the rubber band is let go and your account will grow big time.

Typically I would say consider doing more than 10% with how much you are making. You are young so 10% is solid but if you can do more that money will really work for you in the long run being in your early 20s.

In general, an HYSA is good for short term savings goals, for emergency funds, and while you're trying to figure out what your next step is.  

For long term, all my serious investing is in mutual funds, mostly indexed mutual funds that are investing in stocks.  I have a lot in my employer's retirement plan (401k), some in IRAs, and some in taxable investment accounts.  A Roth IRA might be right for you either a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA has annual contribution limits that make it unsuitable to dump 100k that's not already in a retirement account.

The IRA contribution limit for 2023 is 6,500.  It's likely to go up a little (maybe a thousand bucks) for 2024, but the IRS typically announces that in late october.

Investments inside an IRA grow tax free, as opposed to the same investments in a taxable investment account.  dividends and trades in a taxable account are...  taxed.  But the up-side of a taxable account is there are no age restrictions.  IRAs are intended for saving for retirement, so think about an IRA as locking your money away until you're 59 1/2.  There are always exceptions and such, but I prefer to ignore those.

If you plan on buying in less than 4 years, it should really be kept liquid in a HYSA. Beyond that, it’s up to your risk tolerance. Personally I would go with a target date fund around 2030 or 2035 to get diversification and stability, but equities work too. 

Your emergency fund is going to be pretty hypothetical since you don’t have the statements to average out the actual cost, so do your research and make sure at least 3 months of expenses plus down payment and closing costs are set before buying. If you find the right place or good deal and need to buy but don’t have enough in HYSA, then you look at liquidating the brokerage account till you have enough.

FinancialPlanning,Will the IRS let youu e money from a gifted relative to pay back a personal loan to that same relative?,GremlinShmemlin,"You will be fine receiving all this money at once, with no tax impact to your or your parent.  At least for federal tax.  I can't say for certain that every single state would treat it the same, but the ones I've checked all have pretty similar handling of gifts as the IRS.

The person receiving a gift never has that treated as taxable to them.

The $17k ""annual exclusion"" is the threshold where a gift needs to be *reported* to the IRS on the giver's tax return.  However, the amount above $17k is still not taxable unless the giver has already used up their ""lifetime exemption"", currently sitting at just under $13 million.  To be honest, anyone who has given anywhere close to that should already have professional financial advisors and would be in a position to look into other options.  That probably does not apply to your parents.

And that is an *individual* dollar amount.  This $30k could be treated as being effectively $15k from one parent to you + $15k from the other to you, meaning neither one has to report it.  Though re-reading your post I guess it's not entirely clear whether your parents are still together.  That gift split only works if they are married and giving to you from joint household money.

To be extremely technical, if this is being treated by you + parent as a loan, the IRS somewhat expects some amount of interest to be included in your repayments.  I'm assuming that was the ""Applicable Federal Rate"" you mentioned (I saw 3% as its current level).  If the repaid interest is below that threshold (including you repaying nothing extra), it is treated as a gift for that tax year.  But with this dollar amount that will certainly not reach the $17k level where it matters.  You'd have to be ""borrowing"" over $500k before the unpaid 3% reaches $17k.",sciguyCO

FinancialPlanning,25 y/o beginning of career,Wolfer601,"Regarding the mags backdoor Roth rollover, it is difficult to get this to work in most cases.  Your 401(k) plan must allow for additional after tax contributions (most plans don’t allow for this) if it does allow for this then it is subject to testing. Considering you are not an highly compensated employee (makes more than $150k yr) that works in your favor but to maximize the benefit you would need to put a considerably larger amount into 401(k) plan. 

Considering your age and income it may be good to do some kind of split between pretax and Roth salary deferrals into your 401(k). The maximum for 2023 is $22,500. Many 401(k) plans allow for you to take a loan of 50% of your vested account balance up to $50k from the plan.  If your plan allows for this that’s a great way to have money invested in the market but available if needed.

FinancialPlanning,What will help our kids as adults?,Unknown,"gains are predicated by the type of investments held by the account.  

What kind of help do you want to give them?  I can think of two ideas:

* 529 ""College"" savings plan -- this would be specific to education but not to college.  If its not used for college, the portion of withdrawals that are gains are taxable, including a tax penalty.
* UTMA / UGMA -- this is probably what Grandma set up for you...  my Grandma set one up for me back before Ma Bell was broken up.  This becomes theirs once they're of age -- but ""of age"" varies from state to state...  I've heard 18 to 21 typically.  That assume, however, that the kid knows about the account.  I didn't, so I'd been adulting for almost 10 years before I got mine.

Just like anything, performance is going to depend upon what the underlying investments are.  Bank products will underperform -- if you're really look for gains, you probably want a mutual fund that invests in the stock market.

The 10 year vesting makes is tough.  You don't want to leave before you vest and once you do, you don't want to leave.  Freedom in career choice is important and if you are working for the state, you are likely already underpaid.  


You can do quick math of the contributions being made to the 403b and see that it's the better deal.  TRS 'feels safer' but then remember it's being run as conservatively as possible but by a state that has a hard time balancing their budget.  They can go bankrupt or cut it at any time.  They set how much you are going to get each year based on worst case...otherwise the fund would run out of money.  If there is a surplus, they keep it and not you...and that sucks.  


I mentioned this before but if you have TRS then when you die your wife can get some monthly check or your kids can till they are 18 but then it stops...forever.  If you save up 2 million in your 403b and you die, your wife/kids get it all.  If they are smart, they end up passing that to their kids.

In reality, TRS or any other pension is the same as a 401k/403b, it's just managed by someone other than you and they keep the principle after enough people die or grow up.  So yes, you have to be a grown up and look at investments, but I trust myself to make better decisions for me and my family compared to some TRS manager.

FinancialPlanning,Roth IRA - Income Limit ?,user222897,">I have already contributed the $6,500 back in March. Do I now need to withdraw $6,500?

Yes, but it's not quite as simple as requesting a ""withdrawal"".  You need to specifically do a ""removal of excess contributions"", your IRA provider should be able to walk you through that process.  That acts as an ""undo"" of your past contribution, effectively resulting in your brokerage reporting you had $0 in 2023 Roth IRA contributions, which means you're within your allowed limit (also $0).  You have until April 15th 2024 to complete that removal and bypass any penalty. 

However, while that money's been sitting in the IRA, it may been growing in value.  That growth *also* has to get removed since it shouldn't really have been in there in the first place.  Say the portion of your balance the initial $6500 represents is now worth $7000.  You would get a check / transfer of $7000 (reducing your IRA's balance that same amount), your $6500 2023 contribution is undone, and that $500 growth gets reported as taxable income that goes onto your tax return.  Given what you mentioned about your income, I'd think you're in the 24% bracket, so in my example your tax bill increases $500 \* 24% = $120, reducing your refund / increasing ""amount owed"" by that amount.

There used to be an early withdrawal penalty applied to those removed earnings on top of the tax, but that got removed in the last year or so.  Just mentioning it in case you come across old articles (from before that change) in any of your research.  

>I had a friend tell me to keep it in there and that $6,500 would just be taxed in the future… that didn’t make much sense to me, but I am new to this.

Well, your friend is somewhat correct.  If you contribute above your allowed 2023 limit, the IRS charges you an overcontribution penalty on your 2023 tax return you'll file early next year.  But if you still leave that excess money in the Roth IRA, you continue to be charged that 6% on every future tax return in 2025, 2026, and so on.  There seems to be a maximum number of penalties (5 or 6 years past the initial one?), but even then that's not a great deal.

>I know the option for a “back door Roth” but I’m moreso asking about my contribution I’ve already made.

If you were considering the backdoor for 2023, after doing that Roth removal you can then proceed with it as if you never had a Roth contribution.  Or instead of the Roth removal, you could ""recharacterize"" your Roth contribution to retroactively treat it as if it'd gone into the Traditional in the first place.  That'd basically replace the ""make non-deductible Traditional contribution"" step of the backdoor when started from scratch.  Same end result, slightly less paperwork.",sciguyCO
FinancialPlanning,Roth IRA - Income Limit ?,user222897,"The Roth contribution deadline is in April, same as tax return filing.

FinancialPlanning,Roth IRA - Income Limit ?,user222897,Sorry- I meant *May. Mistake on my part.,user222897
FinancialPlanning,Roth IRA - Income Limit ?,user222897,"You don't convert ""to backdoor roth"".  You convert money that is in a Traditional and it gets moved into a regular Roth IRA.  The ""backdoor"" is just a name for a process that can get new money added into a Roth IRA when the owner would not normally be allowed to do that due to exceeding the IRS's income requirements.  A Roth conversion is simply a step in that process.

Doing a Traditional => Roth conversion causes you to owe tax on moved money that had not already been taxed in the past.  

For a regular Traditional contribution you get to claim a tax deduction, making those dollars untaxed for the year they were put in.  Converting those into a Roth is taxable.

Earnings / growth that happens inside a Traditional IRA is also not taxed.  So converting those into a Roth is taxable.

Contributions that were reported as ""non-deductible"" were already taxed (since no deduction was taken).  So converting those into a Roth is **not** taxed again.

The catch is that you don't get to choose which ""bucket"" of dollars are moved during a given conversion.  You add up all the pre-tax dollars in the Traditional IRA, divide that by the total balance (pre-tax + already taxed) to get a percentage.  Any conversion applies that ""pro rata"" percentage to set the mix of taxable and untaxable amount being moved.  So if you have a balance that is 25% non-deducted contributions, converting $10,000 means that the other 75% ($7500) is reported as taxable to the IRS and you owe them their cut.",sciguyCO

ETFs--broker makes commission only when you buy & sell.

Mutual Funds may not have front end load but then a broker sold fund will have a 12B-? \[I think 2\] fee which is assessed annually and the broker will get some commission/payout yearly; might be paid quarterly. That is why you see 1.75%.

For example, the Vanguard All-Equity ETF Portfolio (VEQT) would give you exposure to over 13,000 companies all over the world for an MER of 0.24%. If you would rather build your own portfolio, you could do so with their index ETFs.",SlyTrout

in the US, it can be very complicated to have ETFs within a workplace retirement plan like a 401k. so mutual funds are still the standard in some situations. those mutual fund fees are high by US standards, but may be more common in Canada. just shop around, talk to a different bank or investment provider.

FinancialPlanning,Girlfriend feels we made a mistake buying our first house,GroundbreakingCow937,"The following is based on a LOT of assumptions. I assume your monthly combined take home after taxes, retirement, benefits, etc. is around $8000. With that, your mortgage is about 38% of your takehome which is decent. I'm also assuming that mortgage number is including PMI, home insurance, hoa and a warranty if you have one. If I assume your electricity will be about $120, gas about $50 and trash/recycle about $25 then all in you're looking at about $5500. That leaves you with $2500 at the end of every month. That's good. HOWEVER, I absolutely DO NOT believe these are all your expenses. $500 a month for food for two people is $8.33 per day per person and frankly you're not doing that. Plus, you for sure spend money on some sort of entertainment. I'll ballpark your actual food and entertainment budget conservatively at $1500 per month. That leaves you with $1000 at the end of every month. $1000 wiggle room has the potential to be a bit scary for two people. That's one big car problem or a house problem away from being debt if you don't already have a decent savings. If I were you I'd encourage her to sell her car, let her use my car and buy a cheap used car as the second car if I absolutely need it. A $700 car payment is ridiculous, especially with your salaries. You don't need to be driving the newest cars at the expense of your financial future.

For a lot of people, the first couple years of marriage or cohabitation can be really frustrating as they figure out how to work through important things together and how to share space. What might be key here is that you and your partner decide that your relationship is more important than other things, like preferences about how clean your house is or how you handle finances. A lot of relationships end because two good people never really become ‘one person’.

It’s awesome that you jumped in and did this together. You took the leap! It’s a learning experience either way. And what doesn’t break you up will make you a stronger couple. Financially, you’re gonna look back in five years and know more than you know today. It might turn out to be an expensive seminar, but it will teach you a lot.

Whether they face extreme optimism or pessimism, markets eventually revert to saner, long-term valuation levels. According to this theory, returns and prices will go back to whence they came—reversion generally puts the market back to a previous state. So when it comes to individual investors, the lesson is clear: Make a plan and stick to it. Try to weigh out the importance of everything else that's going on around you and use your best judgment. Don't get thrown by the daily chatter and turmoil of the marketplace.

I understand if they need to get to and from work. But I'm sure there are cheaper vehicles out there that would work for that purpose or alternatives if they live close enough to work or could work from home.

FinancialPlanning,Girlfriend feels we made a mistake buying our first house,GroundbreakingCow937,"I agree.

OP, the car payments and gas is taking a big bite out of your take home.  Do you have public transit or good bike options?  If so you may consider reducing the amount you drive.

Depending on their interest rates I’d pay the cars off to help with your cash flow.  Hopefully you bought reliable cars you can drive for a very long time.

You definitely want to max out your 401k match if you have that and try to max out Roth, 401ks when you can.

At this point I wouldn’t worry about the house- I would assume you don’t have much control over this expense.  One risk of buying a nice house is feeling the need of furnishing and improving it.  Try to resist the non-essentials until you get your financial situation under control.",rythmyouth

FinancialPlanning,Girlfriend feels we made a mistake buying our first house,GroundbreakingCow937,"I was in a position with my wife where we wanted to stop renting, even if the market was bad. We barely made the down payment and it was around 5% too iirc. I have a decent income but we didn't have the time or desire to wait for it. Sometimes it can't just wait a year to build up that down payment, and in certain markets you never know that houses won't continue to go up for a few years. At that point, you're saying you'll wait for the market to crash or go down, which is now a several years commitment. Your last point kind of indicates that's the ideal outcome, but not everyone is in a place in life where that's the best move, even if it's financially the best. 

I definitely agree on the cars - if possible, they should focus their smaller loans (phones, watch, cars) and take those out one by one snowball-style to free up some money. Then probably put extra towards the house. 

I agree the interest rate is bad on the house, so like OP said, refinancing is something they should look into saving up for and getting handled ASAP.",Grandmaster_Caladrel

FinancialPlanning,Girlfriend feels we made a mistake buying our first house,GroundbreakingCow937,"it’s not about morality… that’s not why people are questioning buying a house with a girlfriend or boyfriend…

it’s about legal issues attached to marriage around property ownership, etc.  buying the house unmarried brings new risks associated with ownership and estate issues.  wills and estates may be required for dating couple co-owning property but unmarried.   there may be tax complexities as well.  they are essentially business partners but without any form of incorporation or legal agreement on the business arrangement.   there are likely life insurance needs unless one individual can go on without the other and sell off the debt or assume it all.   breakups are usually messy and breakups where there’s no legal marriage and dispute about property or other aspects of the estate are risky/difficult when the two parties are unmarried.

if both partners are in the mortgage, either can be held responsible for the entire amount.   tax situation is typically worse for unmarried couples.

if they do break up, it’s unlikely either can buy out the others share, which means a sale would be necessary (or foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc) so now you have to agree on a sale price at a time e when you are likely not agreeing on anything.

depending on whose name is on the mortgage and on the title or deed.   

nobody cares they are playing house, just that they are likely unaware of the financial and legal situation they’ve potentially put themselves in.   when married couples divorce there are processes to deal with assets from the marriage.   there are no processes when the assets are not in a marriage but in a dating relationship.",Rawlus

FinancialPlanning,Girlfriend feels we made a mistake buying our first house,GroundbreakingCow937,"It has nothing to do with that. Marriage is a legal protection when you own property or assets together. 

What happens if your girlfriend dies? Who is her next of kin? *It’s not you.* Have you written up wills and outlined what will happen with the house in the event of death? Or can a relative fight for ownership of her half and force you to sell and relinquish her half of the equity? What if she goes into a coma? Are you her power of attorney? Who takes control of her assets in that situation? Her parents? Her siblings? If either of you has a major medical event the other person is vulnerable and likely to lose the house (without getting to keep all your equity like you would if you were married). 

If a marriage ends in divorce, a court can divide assets and debt equitably. If your girlfriend leaves you and refuses to pay her portion of the mortgage, you’re not going to be able to sue for alimony. If you don’t pay her half you’d lose the house. 

Marriage is a legal contract and it serves a legal purpose.

FinancialPlanning,Girlfriend feels we made a mistake buying our first house,GroundbreakingCow937,"The difference is a marriage has to go through a legal process involving a lawyer.

If you’re both on the title, one of you could technically move out and leave the other one with the bill. You would either have to sue for the amount to get back if they left you. And then try to argue why it wasn’t fair for them to move out to begin with.

In a marriage, it would be very easy to split the property 50/50. And a partner wouldn’t be able to just up and leave and leave the other one with the mortgage since they were both legally married and thus responsible both for the property. The lawyers in a divorce can assess this. 

Even if you want to say, “well she loves me she would never leave me.” Partners leave all the time even after 10 or more years or in marriage. Never assume it can’t happen to you.

Marriage comes with legal protection. Being bf and gf does not. What is your plan the day she leaves you and then you’re stuck with property and she refuses to sell the house?

FinancialPlanning,Girlfriend feels we made a mistake buying our first house,GroundbreakingCow937,"You get that interest rates increasing doesnt affect current home owners right?  It would only effect people who bought at the higher interest rate and then if rates still go up after that then those increases dont effect them.  Same rules apply, don't buy if you cant afford when you buy just crossing fingers hoping something changes.  But that is no more true now than it was 10 years ago.

I bought 8 years ago.  My house tripled in value because with rates lowering prices skyrocketed and I live in a VHCOL area.  Over the last year my house has shed 200k of that inflated value but it is still 2x what it was when I bought it.  Interest rates going up havent affected me.  The value of my home changing hasnt affected me other than property tax going up and now it looks like starting to come down which honestly is if anything good for me.  If houses drop value they tend to all do in the area so that means if I do decide to sell the value I lost is made up for by the lower house prices in general.

I get right now it sucks, it takes a long time for higher or lower rates to have their full impact.  But if we stick with higher rates it WILL lower prices or at least stop them from rising outpacing income significantly and that overall will be better for first time buyers.

The problem is, as someone else stated, we have a 4 year election cycle and most people (for understandable reasons) don't have the stomach for the rough transition so the first political party that promises to lower rates will probably win and then they will lower rates and all the suffering from the transition will have been wasted.  Then 10 years from now when prices have inflated even more someone else will try to raise interest rates to fix the problem and probably same thing will happen.  We need interest rates to be higher.  They were absurdly low and that has led to the situation we are in now.  You can't just hold interest rates at like 0.2% and just assume that will mean growing economy forever.

Even with a Roth 401k you can avoid RMDs with a rollover, so it’s probably not a big worry at this point.

To me, a good expense ration is <0.1% for a passive fund, and I don’t care to invest in active funds. You can pretty easily set up a three fund portfolio where all three of your funds will have less than 0.1% expense ratio. This ratio is critical, because it is taken every year, so it compounds over time.

Other people are ok with ~0.5 to 1% expense ratios for funds that do lots of active trading (esp. international funds), but higher than that is definitely pushing it.",bgon42r

FinancialPlanning,Only $15K saved in 401K. How can I catch up?,beats_Audio,"You're 30. You have plenty of time to catch up. Saving $14K your first year at a new job making about $100K is pretty close to what you should be aiming for if you want a comfortable retirement at the typical retirement age: 15% of your before-tax salary. Increase your savings bit by bit. When you get a raise, put it all toward savings. If you have a company 401K, be sure to contribute enough to get the full match. After that, Roth vs. Traditional tax-advantagd savings don't make a lot of difference unless you're planning to retire early, in which case you need to lean heavily toward the Roth option.

You can contribute by yourself up to $22,500/year combined total for roth and pretax. The $22,500 doesn't include employer match so $22,500 of your money from your paychecks can go in. 

You can open a Roth ira and put in $6500/year. This is separate you can contribute to this and a 401k. 

Pre Tax: 
Lowers your taxable income
Have to pay fed taxes and possibly state tax on withdrawals in the future

Roth:
Pay taxes now take home less money per paycheck

FinancialPlanning,Only $15K saved in 401K. How can I catch up?,beats_Audio,"Super back of the napkin math (TLDR: save at least 15%):

100K salary at 60% replacement rate = 60K income needed in retirement

60K at 4% safe withdraw rate = 1.5M needed in today's dollars

1.5M in 35 years at 3% inflation = 4.2M

Starting at 14K saving 1200 per month with a 10% rate of return = 4.2M in 35 years

That is a 15% savings rate, but I would recommend adding a bit more incase inflation is higher than 3% or your rate of return is less than 10%.

I have about $14K now saved in a 401K match plan with my current employer. I’ve been reading that by my 40s, I should have about 3x my salary saved, which would be $300K. I am nowhere near that, and I would probably have to save more than twice as much per year (~$31K) to even get there by 40. 

I am able to save about $2000 per month on average. To be honest, I am not sure how much I can budget for retirement at this point. I have a lot of things I am dropping into sinking funds, a house being one of my top priorities.

FinancialPlanning,Only $15K saved in 401K. How can I catch up?,beats_Audio,"An index fund is where a company buys shares across the majority of the market. 

Then people buy shares within the index fund, and they are charged are very small fee by the company which maintains the index fund (you only want to invest in good, low fee index funds - low fees are typically 0.1-0.3% per year). 

So because an index fund effectively mirrors the performance of the market, it means you are minimising risk (risk of losing money on your investment is basically 0), whilst you are getting very stable long term returns (the market ALWAYS trends upwards over a long term period). 

An index fund is also very tax efficient - because you are not regularly selling / buying shares (which would see capital gains taxes). Because you are typically only ever investing more into your index fund at strategical intervals (say once every 3/6/12 months depending on your financial situation).

There has been an absolute mountain of research published over the years demonstrating that index funds provide the best investment returns for majority of people. So instead of trying to “beat” the market (trying to pick the hottest stocks), you are invested in the market as a whole. 

For example - They researched a wide variety of the best financial advisors in USA and determined that only like 7% ended up beating the market when following through with their “stock picks”, and for a customer like yourself - that number would be even lower because financial advisors also charge their own fees (so you would have to beat the market plus earn more then that to cover the cost of using a financial advisor). 

Using index funds - you typically see your investment double every ~7.5 years. 

So as an example of someone using an index fund:

Lets say you invest 30K when you’re 28 years old, and you start investing $500 per month into your index fund. By the time you are 65 - that investment will be worth around 3.5 million dollars.",En_Route_2_FYB

The S&P is typically the S&P 500.  That is Standard & Poors 500 largest public companies.  It is an index as well.  There are funds and ETFs that mimic the makeup of the S&P 500.  SPY is one of them.  

So, if the VIX is up, or going up, says something about market volatility and “fear”.  However you want to interpret that.  If volatility is high and people are selling stocks, S&P 500 may be going down.

I think the imply here is to buy the S&P when it could be going down based on the VIX being up at higher percentages.  When it’s down, just keep dumping money into the S&P.  It’s like dollar cost averaging but using the VIX to try timing the market.",mschre2

FinancialPlanning,Should I withdraw my IRA to purchase a home.,pleasehelp1932,"**No way pulling out from the IRA.**
I wouldn't pay the taxes and penalty. No way.   

You make 140k.  
You'll add 120k of income to that. That's going to get taxed at your marginal rate and then some. That's 22-24% at federal alone. That's roughly 27.6k. Add in the 10% penalty for another 12k. What about state?  

Your 120k would become ~80k as a high end estimate. Likely less. No way.

If you wait until retirement, you get to fill in the standard deduction of 0%, the 22k at 10%, 78k @ 12%, AND avoid the 10% penalty. **If you wait, you get taxed at 0-12% instead of 32-34%.**    
This is 100% shooting yourself in the foot. 

**I would consider other options.**  
You can pay down the home faster with cash flow since you've already decided this debt is worth paying down faster.  

If you get a 15 year mortgage, [you get a .84% discount on the rate.](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates/#mortgage-industry-insights) Roughly 20% higher mortgage payment. Reduces interest paid by 60%. Some of that is from the lower rate, some from paying extra.   

You can also take a look at the 5/1 ARM. That gives a 1.18% discount on the rate. [Currently, the absolute worst case scenario has the 30 year fixed losing to the 5/1 ARM for around 9 years.](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/wiki/homes#wiki_.2A_how_to_evaluate_fixed_vs_arm_rates.3F) If rates don't double from here and stay at that level for 10-20 years, there's a good chance the ARM wins for any time frame.  

Right now, we're right around the historic median. If you get the ARM, rates stay flat, and make the 30 year fixed payment, you'll pay off the house in 22 years. A reduction in interest of 43%.   
If you get the ARM, rates stay flat, and you make the 15 year payment, you'll pay off the house in 14.5 years. If that's your plan, I would go for 15 year mortgage for stability. You could go for ARM, make the 15 year payment, and have the option to reduce the extra payments if times get tough.

Rates have to go up a lot for the ARM to lose to the fixed. ARMs are far more attractive than they used to be, and far safer than people think they are. We're no longer in the 2008 era with no regulations.",ullric

FinancialPlanning,Vanguard ROTH IRA,Foreign_Mulberry_211,"Vanguard is very easy to work with.  You contact them, request opening a new Roth IRA, and as part of that process you include that you have an existing one to rollover into it.  Most (if not all) of that can be done online; you might need to have some phone conversations or extra paperwork with a customer service representative.  You'll tell them information about your existing Roth (who it's with, account number, approximate balance) and they handle most of the back-end stuff.

Most commonly, your current IRA holdings get liquidated, that cash transferred to your new Vanguard Roth, at which point you can use it to buy whatever funds match your desired portfolio.  

There is zero tax impact for selling anything in a Roth IRA or rolling that cash to another Roth IRA.  This rollover does not count as a withdrawal when coming out of the starting IRA.  It also does not count as a contribution against your annual limit when put into the destination IRA.  You can rollover as much as you want during a year and still be allowed up to the max $6500 of new contributions.

Your existing account may charge you a ""closure"" or ""transfer"" fee to execute the rollover.  This shouldn't be too harsh, the worst I've seen was $75 per investment account (in case you're moving something more than just the IRA).  Some brokerages will refund that fee when you move your business over to them, but I don't think I've heard of Vanguard doing that.  Could be worth asking about, though.

You need a 6mo emergency fund of $7k or $8k, and, yes, you want it in a High Yield Savings Account... you can make 4.5% at SoFi, 4.3% at CapitalOne.  You're probably not starting at $0, but even if you are, that'll only take you through Dec 31 to accomplish.

Once you have that, go ahead with the Roth.  You have until Apr 15 2024 to make your $6.5k contribution for 2023.  I like Fidelity, myself.  At Fidelity, you would open the Roth and invest the money in FZROX, which is a zero-fee total market mutual fund which basically owns a sliver of every company in the United States.  If you'd rather go with Vanguard, great, invest in VTI inside the Roth.  You have from Jan 1 2024 to Apr 15 2025 to make the 2024 Roth contribution, which will be $7k, so I would work on that next.

You sound fuzzy on whether you can contribute to an HSA or a 401k.  If you can't, no problem, if you have any additional money after the emergency fund and 2 years of Roth contributions, then open an Individual brokerage account wherever you've put your Roth and invest in the same investments as the Roth (FZROX or VTI).  You might have some very small dividends in this account.  Set the dividends in the Roth and the Individual accounts to reinvest automatically for convenience.  Taxes on dividends will be $0 in the Roth (tax free!) and either 0% or 15% of that very small amount in the Individual, depending on your income.

Don’t touch the IRA.  Penalties and taxes will make it only worth about 5-6k 

Sell stuff you don’t need……anything helps right now.

Make the minimum payment on the care credit so that it’s paid off right on 4/1/24 when interest starts kicking in. I’d cancel every subscription you can and throw that $260 towards it.  If you have an emergency, put it back on your credit card.  At least this way you are reducing the balance in the meantime.  Find savings even within things like buying generic groceries, shopping out your insurance, etc.

Finding a CC intro with a lower rate or a balance transfer at a lower interest rate would be a great path also.  

As your debts are paid off, hurl that money towards the credit card as well.

It looks as if you have some bills that are almost to their ends. Pay them 1st after making your minimum payments. Having less bills each month will feel less overwhelming and give you a sense of accomplishment.

After a year or 2, depending on how much extra you bring in, your CC will be paid off.

Then you can work on increasing your emergency savings.

FinancialPlanning,"$25,000 in credit card debt, I’m desperate for advice.",jsquigs,"Hey there! Glad you're feeling better after reading these comments. I'm going to give my 2 cents since I'm here.  
  
First, you mention that you make around $3,000 a month after insurance and taxes, but your budget is only around $2,870. Is that additional $130 hiding somewhere or is that just the ""around"" $3,000?  
  
Assuming that's the case, let's look at your non-negotiables.  
  
Rent, Energy, Water all seem good.  
  
Internet seems a little high, are you paying for gigabit? You might need to bump that down to save \~$50 (depending on where you live and what your costs are), if possible. If not, see if there is any competition in the area.  
  
Insurance (all) - If you haven't already, I recommend looking into bundling all of your insurance. At first I was under the impression that you were buying a home with your partner but it sounds like you're renting, which is fine (but often not preferable in the long run), so I guess homeowner's isn't in your list for that reason.   
  
I had to look up Care Credit and I'm glad I did, that sounds like a really useful resource. In addition, since I see that you have a handful of health-related bills, I would check to see if your job provides an HSA/FSA option. That would allow you to use pre-tax income designated for health costs, which can add up over time and help stretch your dollars.  
  
Car - I get having a PoS. I had an old car that would have problems once or twice a year, but luckily I was able to handle most of them myself with some instruction. I am also very aware that I was lucky and lots of people (likely you included) have less experience or less luck with the car.  
  
\---  
  
I can continue to point out the good-looking things, but I'd rather just cut to what I have stuff to say about.  
  
Credit card, and the cause of your main woes - if your minimum payment is $521, you need to be paying $521. Frankly, you need to be paying more, so you're actually applying something to your principal. That said, I highly recommend you find a place to consolidate your loans instead so you can lower your minimum and help ease the tension here.   
  
Personal savings - Savings are good, and it's important to have a safety cushion. You said you have 0 savings and $150 checking though, which means you haven't been prioritizing it up until now either. I recommend you start building up your savings to a point that you could handle basic emergencies (flat tire or other problem, refrigerator goes out, etc), but leave it there until you can start hitting your debt harder. And if you think your savings are there to grow, you're dead wrong. Interest rates on debt like you have right now will easily kill any returns on investment you make. Savings and investments are ways of making money with money you have, but you're net negative right now so you don't have any money to grow yet. First step is to stop hemorrhaging the money that's coming in.  
  
Subscriptions - This is your budget and isn't including your partner, right? What subscriptions do you have that are adding up to $70? If it's mostly streaming platforms, I recommend choosing one and dropping the others (temporarily if you wish) until you build up your savings account at least, that way you can move that bigger chunk of money towards loan payments sooner.   
  
Also, I prefer ""avalanche"" over ""snowball"" myself because that's how you really save money long-term, but it seems like you are extremely stretched on your finances. I recommend chunking anything you can spare (ex: subscription extra or personal savings) at your shorter-term debts, even if they have low or no APR. This includes your IRS, Medical, Afterpay, and Care Credit payments. I'd order them based on interest since they're all small enough, sounds like. If there are pre-payment penalties then you'll have to drag those out I guess.  
  
I've already kinda said the same thing over and over, so here are my bullet points:  
  
\- Lower your subscriptions costs if possible  
\- Personal savings should only be big enough to act as a temporary emergency fund - after that, your savings will be your liquidity from fewer debt payments  
\- Take out your smaller loans to give your more month-to-month liquidity  
\- Like everyone else recommends, see if you can consolidate/transfer your C.C. debt  
  
Once you get to that point, I recommend moving back towards savings and debt payments - up your savings to a healthier amount so you have a real safety cushion matching your situation and needs, then try to pay everything extra you can towards your debt.  
  
If you want to give yourself some additional fun money, I recommend setting aside a dedicated amount each month (budget, separate account, idc) and limiting yourself to just that - NO OVERSPENDING. If you need to revise to increase that amount sure, but don't go over your fun budget.  
  
Also, if no one else already recommended it, there is a handy flow chart in this sub that has helpful breakpoints into where and when to put your money. Read over that. It's matches most of my opinions, mainly because most of it follows common financial sense that I was raised with.",Grandmaster_Caladrel

I'd look into cutting down on rent -- 1700/mo with split costs IMO might be a little too nice for your situation.  Get something in the 1100-1200 range.  Would probably net you an additional 200/mo.  Reduce subscriptions (get that down to like 20$. Consider slower internet speeds, Try to shave groceries at least 100$.  

To me -- Loan, Rent, Subscription cut, Internet cut, Grocery cutback -- Might be able to yield you an extra $500/mo or so.  Plus if the list above all adds up into the take home (a few look like are coming off your books) might jump you up to 700-750 in savings,

Then you take a few months of that doing that, to rebuild your savings in case your car or w/e shits the bed, while still paying your new loan debt.    I'd shoot for like at least 2k in savings.

I went through the budgets and trying everything I could to pay down my balances (between 7% and 20% interest across 2 credit cards and 1 line of credit, as well as a car loan). It made my anxiety so severe that I would literally have nightmares and wake up with numbers running through my head. 

I will warn you that my method was super unconventional. I can't tell if you are male or female from your post, but I got out of it when I left my healthcare job and worked at a body rub parlor. As you can imagine, anything can happen once that door is closed, and I charged whatever I wanted... which was a LOT. 

Within 6 months, 20k of my debt was gone. I then met a wealthy client who paid off the rest of my debt in order to get me to quit and give him a chance with dating. However, based on what I was making, I would've gotten out of that debt within a year of starting that job anyway. Went from making 3k/month to 3k a week, sometimes more. 

I'm not saying you should do this specific kind of work (especially if you're a man lol), just saying that sometimes you have to make radical choices to get you the result you want. I chipped away at this debt for over 3 years with no progress - I made more progress in the first 3 months of this work than I did in the previous 3 years combined. 

While I don't think I could do that work again (being both a moral and legal grey area), I had tons of fun along the way and it will always be a cherished memory.

Instead of saving a dedicated car fund just have it as part of your emergency fund.

Once you hit 3k stop saving and throw absolutely everything at debt. By that time you should be done with all of the misc monthly payments(after pay, IRS, credit care?)

I used credit karma to find other credit cards to apply for.

I opened a credit card with promo no interest and did a credit transfer. They gave me a 6k balance with no interest for like 6 months maybe a year, can’t remember. Realized I needed more, so I opened 2 more accounts. They were both approved for around 3k each. And same thing, like 6-12 months no interest.

We stopped spending money as much as humanly possible. No theater, no eating out, no going anywhere, no entertainment of any kind except Netflix. We made do with what we had. The only thing we could have stopped but didn’t was buying alcohol, we just figured out a more cost effective way.

Before we did this I was paying $450 each month to try and pay it off. I saw that $250 was going to interest alone, so really I was only paying $200 each month to the principal. That’s why I chose to do that route. Personal loans usually start with interest immediately.

It would be worth saying that I was also paying a transfer fee each time, I think it was between 3-5% of total transferred amount? But it beat paying $250 interest every month for who knows how long.

There was about 3 months of planning while we tried to do all this. Applying for new CC’s takes time, transfers took time. I think it took about 3 months before we had the 3 extra accounts. We still had owed money in the original credit card so we focused on paying that first. Then went to the next card with the earliest promo expiration.

That said, it’s hard to give advice without knowing specifics, but having been in a similar situation (maybe not as dire), here is what I found (what worked for me may not work for you)…
1. Having positive cash flow and a plan and an accountability partner took away most of my stress
2. Balance transfers often have a 2-5% transfer fee, so watch out. I’d stay away
3. Income needs to go up and expenses need to come down. I worked 9-5 at my regular job, and then 3-7 unloading trucks at UPS. The latter income went straight to paying down debt and kept me in shape. Caught up on sleep on weekends. 
4. Track every single penny you spend, keep a spreadsheet with cash flow projections and actuals. This is what kept me motivated as I knew what my debt free date was. I was good at spreadsheets  so that helped
5. Sacrifice - I did not eat out for a full year. Or go for a movie. I had no cable. Did not go on vacations. Just watched what was over the air. But I did this knowing what my debt free date would be. 
6. I used cash for a while. The envelope system. I also did consolidate debt via a credit union via a personal fixed rate loan. Lower interest rate, and a loan end date helped me.

FinancialPlanning,"$25,000 in credit card debt, I’m desperate for advice.",jsquigs,"Emergency Fund: While it's important to pay down your debt, it's also essential to have an emergency fund to cover unexpected expenses. Considering your current situation, you might want to temporarily reduce your personal savings contribution from $260 to, let's say, $100 or $150. This will free up some extra money to put toward your credit card debt while still maintaining a small savings cushion.

  
Debt Snowball or Avalanche: You can employ one of these strategies to pay off your credit card debt more effectively. The snowball method involves paying off your smallest debts first, which can provide a psychological boost. The avalanche method, on the other hand, targets high-interest debts first to minimize interest payments. Given your high credit card interest rate, the avalanche method may be more beneficial.

  
Consider a Balance Transfer: As you mentioned, transferring a portion of your credit card debt to a card with a 0% APR introductory offer can save you money on interest. While you won't be able to transfer the entire $25,000, transferring a portion can help. Just be aware of balance transfer fees, and make sure you have a plan to pay it off before the introductory period ends.

  
Personal Loan: Taking out a personal loan with a lower APR than your credit card can be a good option to consolidate and pay off high-interest debt. Contact your bank or credit union to inquire about loan options. However, be sure to budget for the monthly loan payment, and only use the loan for paying off the credit card debt.

  
Additional Income: Explore opportunities for increasing your income, as you mentioned with selling plasma or taking on a part-time job. DoorDash could also be a viable option, even if your car isn't the most fuel-efficient. The additional income can go directly toward paying off your debt.

  
Credit Counseling: Consider reaching out to a non-profit credit counseling agency. They can provide advice, negotiate with creditors on your behalf, and potentially set up a debt management plan to lower your interest rates and create a structured repayment plan.

  
Cut Non-Essential Expenses: Continually evaluate your budget to find areas where you can cut back on expenses. This could include reducing subscription services, finding cheaper grocery options, or minimizing discretionary spending.

  
Track Your Progress: Keep a close eye on your progress in paying down your debt. Seeing the balance decrease over time can be motivating and help you stay on track.",Pointyspoon

4) budget your money and plan ahead for groceries and expenses. Figure out how but you do you here (like rice and beans and frozen veggies or simple wraps or something). One good way is to do envelopes with cash in them. If there’s no cash you don’t spend it. If it’s an emergency see #3
5) pay off your highest interest rate bill first (pay minimum on rest). (Continue saving some to build up 3 months salary but mix this with getting rid of the interest)

FinancialPlanning,"$25,000 in credit card debt, I’m desperate for advice.",jsquigs,"One other thing, there are a few strategies to pay off debt. Two of the most common are the avalanche method which focuses on your highest APR debt first and the debt snowball method, which focuses on your slowest balance first. Are all of the amounts you listed the minimum payments?

I think in this situation, after you call your creditors to see if they can extend the term or lower your rates, is to get the small “mental wins” of debt snowball method. 

You have Afterpay, IRS, Medical Bills, and care credit as your debts before your credit card. Based on your payoff date and amount they are around $120, $360, $480, $1210. Your CC racks up $310 a month in interest, so you could pay that to keep your principal the same. 

You collectively pay $390 a month towards other debts. If you focus all $390 on your lowest balance first, you would have all of them paid off by March. Once that is paid off, you can take the $390 and put it to the credit card. So your payment now is $700 a month to the CC starting in March.",schruteski30

I would get a gig job. You have a car you can use it. Work an extra 10 hours a week right now on Saturdays to get this mess under control. $25,000 in CC debt is not acceptable and will be a unfair burden on your partner if you decide to get married. I would try ask for some money as a loan from your parents as well if you are young to try and get you started that way you will be saving money in interest. Own up to the mistake and make yourself accountable by sharing the burden with others.

You do not have the luxury of weekends or going out to eat anymore. You should to Doordash on saturday as those are peak earning times. You should be able to make an extra $800 pcm by doing this. That means you can attack the debt more. I would say go to church on Sunday and bring the partner along as you need to be strong in mind and purpose together as a team you will also meet new people as a couple and they might also be able to help and give the odd job here and there. Get the partner if he/she does not have debt to fork a little more on the rent like 55:45 especially if you are the girl. If he loves you and views you as marriage material in the future he will 100% invest in you now if he sees longer term mileage in it. If not well he is kind of letting you know he expects you to improve before he is going to take you seriously and I would not blame him to what extent will you commit to changing your bad habits that got to this point? I don't know you he might know you better than me and if that were to happen if I were in your shoes it would make me look in the mirror and be a bit of a wake up call.

Keep the IRA money growing at 5% per year and don't take this money out as you will have to pay taxes and a 10% penalty. The IRA money can be used up to $10,000 for a deposit for your first home and then hopefully if your BF/GF can do the same when you decide to get married you will have $20k saved for a first condo.

FinancialPlanning,"$25,000 in credit card debt, I’m desperate for advice.",jsquigs,"Bankruptcy isn’t the stigma it used to be.  Consult with a bankruptcy lawyer for the specifics in the state you live in.   You don’t have/own anything like a house - although in some states personal residences are exempt.  Generally you can keep a small amount in the and your personal vehicle.  Your retirement account - if you have one is also typically exempt/shielded from creditors.   You will have to submit a lot of paperwork and go before a judge to have bankruptcy approved.  

Bankruptcy will remain on your credit report for 7-10 years, affecting your ability to open credit card accounts and get approved for loans with favorable rates.  But, it will not prevent you from getting credit entirely.   Also, I would advise if that’s the route you are going to take make sure your living situation, employment, transportation is stable, because nowadays any of those things mentioned will make it harder for you to obtain.  You'll need to demonstrate you can't repay your debts and also complete credit counseling with a government-approved credit counselor. The counselor will help you assess your finances, discuss possible alternatives to bankruptcy, and help you create a personal budget plan.

If you decide to move forward with bankruptcy proceedings, you'll have to decide which type you'll file: Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Both types of bankruptcy can help you eliminate unsecured debt (such as credit cards), halt a foreclosure or repossession, and stop wage garnishments, utility shut-offs and debt collection actions. With both types, you'll be expected to pay your own court costs and attorney fees.

If you stating thing like “well I don’t want to lose money”, then your advisor would put you in a more conservative position, meaning more bonds which have done extremely poorly since interest rate hikes.

FinancialPlanning,How much should my money have grown?,rivkipivki,"It's not a simple question of how much your money has grown relative to the market; it's fairly standard to have a report comparing the growth of your investments relative to the market as a whole. However, much of it depends on how aggressively or conservatively your holdings have been allocated, and what you are paying in fees. If you're invested in actively managed funds with a 1% fee, and your manager is charging an additional 1% for assets under management, you're automatically down 2% even if you matched the market perfectly.

Second, it sounds like you're invested rather conservatively. Based on what you said about your 529, I'm going to guess you're in your early 30s? 70/30 really can't be called 'aggressive' for someone at that age, and 60/40 is quite conservative. That's not necessarily a bad thing - I would guess that in your initial meeting with your advisors, they gave you a survey to measure your risk tolerance. If you scored as being particularly risk averse, this could very well be an appropriate asset allocation for you.

Ultimately, what it comes down to is your statement that ""I don't like managing my own investments, which is why I went that route."". The people in this reddit are naturally going to be self-selected DIY investors and financial nerds, but it's perfectly reasonable for someone without that knowledge base or interest to hire someone else to manage their finances. Not everyone knows how to change the oil in their cars, nor should they be expected to. But the fundamental problem you're encountering right now is that you don't have a good frame of reference to understand what you're invested in, why you're invested the way you are, what is appropriate to your needs, or what a fair price for those services are.

You might be invested appropriately based on what you told your advisor initially. Or you may be getting robbed blind. Or both. Or it might have been true in 2020, but is not true today. It's really difficult for anyone here to tell based on the information provided.",glumpoodle

It's totally fine to pay extra principal payments if you wish. But long term investments typically make a little more than 6.59%, although that's close to the average. 

Here's the kicker - if you refinance to 5% or less in the next few years, then the money you ""invested"" into your mortgage principal is essentially only ""earning"" that lower refinanced rate of 5% or whatever it happens to be.

I am currently 26 and had a 401k set up in vanguard at my old job since 2019. Would it be wise for me to transfer the old 401k? 

Not all 401(k) plans are created equal - some are objectively better than others. Compare the fees and investment options of each plan to each other and see which is better. It might make sense to consolidate the two plans, it might not.

> Is it smart to make sure the investment’s are the same so it rolls over correctly?

All 401(k) plans have a different menu of investment options chosen by your employer. It is likely the two plans have different investment options but this doesn't really matter. If you do decide to combine the plans, the old plan will likely be liquidated to cash and they'll send a check.",plowt-kirn

FinancialPlanning,Should i transfer my vanguard 401k to my current jobs Fidelity 401k,DrDragonfruit97,"Moving your old 401k into your new one gives you one less account to keep track of.  And there's the chance that old employer makes changes to their plan (like shifting to a new provider) and the communication about that gets missed.  

>Is it smart to make sure the investment’s are the same so it rolls over correctly?

You almost certainly won't be able to keep the exact same investments, but that doesn't matter much.  The options you get to choose from are set by the plan sponsor (your employer), and I doubt there's much if any overlap.  But there may be plan funds are mostly equivalent: VLXVX (Vanguard's 2065 target date fund) is functionally the same as FFFIJX (Fidelity's index target date fund).  If so, then simply cashing out in your Vanguard 401k (no tax impact) and rolling those dollars into your Fidelity 401k and buying its funds is pretty much a wash.

For many plans, account fees are covered by your employer.  But only while you're at that job, your Vanguard account may now be charging you through a balance deduction.  When I had an old Vanguard 401k the fee was something like $50 a year, split up into chunks deducted each quarter.  That's relatively cheap and could be worth keeping that old 401k if your Fidelity fund options aren't what you'd prefer.  

Or as another option you could rollover that Vanguard 401k balance into a personal IRA (more fund choices and no fee) at either Vanguard or Fidelity.",sciguyCO

If non-qualified, you typically should be given an option to simply take a lump-sum distribution. However, distributions from a non-qualified annuity may be taxable.

Many annuity companies allow you to instead ""stretch"" the distributions across a period of time to spread out the tax ramifications. However, this shouldn't be required. 

If it's an IRA annuity, you simply follow the inherited IRA withdrawal rules. The funds start as an inherited IRA, and you can do as you choose from that point on.

FinancialPlanning,Disability Insurance - Questions about Exclusions,Schnellin,"This is honestly pretty typical. You disclosed pre-existing conditions, they are excluding said pre-existing conditions. The assumption from the insurance company is that you're *far* more likely than average to have an incident requiring a claim from an injury that furthers a pre-existing injury. 

Think like this - you have a back injury. It *may* have fully healed, or it *may* have healed enough to no longer be bothering you. However, it's also very possible your back is far more susceptible to another injury. The insurance company doesn't want to be on the hook for you potentially just re-aggravating an injury, so they're excluding it. 

You certainly should work with your agent to see if they would reduce the restriction level to be more limited instead of so broad, and you could also seek quotes and options from other insurance companies.

Do not lie to an insurance company though. If you do, and you submit a claim in the future, and they find out, that's insurance fraud, and you can get in a lot of trouble.",crzypck

FinancialPlanning,What are the best life insurance options?,UploadedMind,"Do you want life insurance… or do you want money that you can use in retirement?

Yes, there are insurance products that can do both.  But, as with most things in life, anything that is designed to do two different things… doesn’t do either particularly well.

The smart move for most people is to get an inexpensive term-life policy from a reputable company that covers only the amount of life insurance you actually need, and for no longer than that need actually exists.  For most people, this is enough money to cover kids college and pay off the mortgage balance by the time the youngest kid graduates from college.

Depending on your age and health, you should be able to lock that in for less than $1,000 a year.  This will save you thousands and thousands of dollars a year over a cash-value whole-life policy; that savings can be otherwise saved/invested for retirement or other uses.",Maximum-Excitement58
FinancialPlanning,What are the best life insurance options?,UploadedMind,"In broad terms, life insurance is not a great tool for building wealth; most people who say otherwise are in the business of selling you insurance.  It's primarily a protection for the people left behind who relied on the income you'll no longer be providing.  The more protection and longer time you want, the more expensive a policy is going to be.

Early on in your career you don't have many assets **except** your income, so replacing that is more important.  As you get through life you'll (hopefully) be building up a reserve of stuff that can support your family instead of that income.  Once you're retired, you're possibly living entirely off your assets, so no income to replace, so much less impact if you die uninsured.  A small policy to cover funeral costs / pay off remaining debt may be all you'd need.

Term policies get a lot of recommendations because of that change in necessary coverage over your life.  A 20 or 30 year term is relatively cheap, so leaves you with more money today to put towards wealth building.  By the time the term runs out, the expectation is that you'll have enough other stuff to be ""self-insured"".  Some term policies allow you to renew past that end date, though with a recalculated (and higher) monthly premium.

Your 401k is going to be completely separate from any policy you sign up for.  You can't use employer match money for it.  

You may be getting some ""group term life"" coverage as part of your job benefits.  Some common ones I've seen give a 1-3x salary payout, with the premium often covered entirely by the employer.  There may be the option to get a ""supplemental"" policy on top of that, that's usually fully paid by you, still usually at a lower cost than an independent policy.  The drawback to these is that coverage only lasts as long as you stay in this job.  Unless it's ""portable"", but even with that feature, you become fully responsible for the premium, which may be higher than employer + yours during employment.

For shopping around, I've heard good things about [policygenius.com](https://policygenius.com).  They seem primarily focused on term life policies, but I saw an option for a 40-year term.  And if you get to the point of contacting a representative, they may have more than what gets shown that early through the web process.  If you are set on a whole life policy (it is your life + money), Nerdwallet is a pretty reputable site and has a [list of recommended insurers](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/find-best-whole-life-insurance).",sciguyCO
FinancialPlanning,What are the best life insurance options?,UploadedMind,"If you’re looking for a low risk low return option, plain old whole life insurance from a major mutual company is likely your best bet. The 30+ year returns are comparable to government bonds, maybe 3%, and the insurance component may not be enough to protect your family so you might need to layer some term insurance, but it could work. 

The other option is to get something like a variable universal life insurance policy, which invests some of your premiums into the market and should provide better returns, but all of the risk is born on you rather than the insurer. These policies have a lot more moving parts, but no contribution limits make them attractive for high earners. 

It’s important to keep in mind that the intended purpose of insurance is indemnity. That is, to put your financial dependents in the same financial position they would have been if you had lived. If you use it for other things, it will not be as efficient.

Apply for a credit consolidation loan through your bank. That way you’re not trying to pay the bare minimum for each card in 3 different places (it will be very hard to pay off your debt in multiple places when each have different interest rates and they are gouging you with fees). 
Most debt consolidation loans will have a much lower interest rate than your credit cards and typically have that rate for a longer offering period than another credit card. In order for this to work you need to lock your credit cards away so you’re not adding balances to them while paying off your consolidation loan. I wouldn’t close the accounts because keeping them open will help your credit in the long run (however I would cut the cards up while you pay off your loan, that way the accounts are still open but you do not have cards to use. Once you’ve paid off your debt request new cards from the accounts)
Once your debt is consolidated into one place you’ll be amazed at the relief you feel that you’re only sending payments to one account each month - this gives you the freedom to pay more when you can and it all goes to the lump sum of debt instead of trying to sprinkle extra money in multiple places.

Put all 4 cards in a bowl of water in the freezer to start with. Then make a budget for the 1300 of spending money on a monthly basis to make sure you don’t go over. 

Then create automatic transfers to pay off the minimums for each card. In the first month put the 1300 off debt money into an account as an emergency fund

Every other month first pay all card minimum on time from the automatic transfers then pay the remaining from the 1300 to the card with the highest interest rate. You may need to get a second job even if it’s driving for Doordash or Uber or something because if the credit card interest rates are approaching 30% the 1300/mo may not even cover too much of the principal. 

In any event great job on reaching out for help and with some discipline you should be able to dig your household out of this. Best of luck!",M1DN1GHTDAY

Something like:  
PAY OFF MY DEBT!!!!

\- cut down on eating out

\- stop going out so much

\- put $50 more towards my credit card each week ($200/month)

\- build up my savings

\- quit drinking alcohol (it is very expensive, especially if consumed at an establishment)

Log your progress as well. You don't have stop eating and going out altogether but cut down significantly. If you don't save that $50 (or whatever amount you decide - if you decide to do that) try to make it up the next week.

No. Just focus on your student loans. 

>Also, if a home loan is like 7-9% doesn't it make sense to put the vast majority of my funds towards that

It does however the issue is you may not be able to borrow as banks want to maintain a DTI of below 43%. Using 5k gross for easy math minus the $500 that's 10% right there 43-10 = 33%. 33% of 5k gross = $1650 max PITI + PMI, you would not qualify for a 350k loan even with a 20% downpayment. It doesn't matter if YOU think you can manage it, the bank won't approve you for the loan. 

> Granted 30% would be preferable but I'm also not including my SO in these calculations.

FinancialPlanning,How much to put down on a house in my high cost area and 7%+ rates?,DirectEcho5317,"So the difficulty here is we cant know the future. Once you put money into equity (like with a larger downpayment) you cant really claw it back except by selling the house (yes I know HELOCs exiat but that isnt ideal).

So if you put a bunch into a downpayment those funds are locked in and if in future rates drop from 7% to 3% and you can refinance then you will have missed out.

That is the downside anyways.  But I think its unlikely and you cant live in fear.  

Historically 7% mortgages are much closer to the average than 3% is, in fact if anything its still on the low end.  3% only sounds great to some degree in comparison to interest rates being up for savings returns but when those go up so do mortgage rates.

When we retirement plan 7% is a common number used as a target and if you can lock that in as a tax free return it certainly is tempting.

So what would I advise.  I guess think of your investment portfolio.  If you had the option to buy a bond that returns 7% completely tax free (fed and state) but potentially locks that money away well into your retirement...would you be tempted to move half of your investment portfolio into that bond?

FinancialPlanning,Advised to go 100% equities,throwawayinthe818,"You are missing the most important piece of information. What is your yearly spend?

That will dictate the answer. If you spend >$150k per year, than I am worried that your pension and SS are not enough. Your \~$1M in investments will produce roughly $40k/yr at a 4% SWR. So with SS/pension, that is $130k/yr with very little risk.

If you only spend $90k/yr, I agree with 100% equities because you don't need the money. We are at that point just talking about maximizing your returns for your heirs since you won't touch it. Historically, if untouched, a 100 equities portfolio will do better than 60/40 when there is a long horizon. In the case of this paragraph, your horizon would be until death as you have no need for the money.

If you spend $130k/yr, I do not think that increased equities is worth the risk while you would withdraw. In other words, I'd say go 100% until the cash runs out, slowly phasing back to 60/40 or 80/20. 100% equities only help in this scenario for very long retirements (think 50+ years), but living to 110 is unlikely. So I like 80/20 here.

If you spend $150k+ per year that I think you may need to be more aggressive in order to maintain the lifestyle. It might backfire, but you really don't have a choice if you are using a 6-7% SWR, which normally is not a good idea. But if you expect to live until 75-80, isn't insane but still probably ill advised.

If you consider this “strategy” it would be prudent to perform this action based on a reallocation when the market dips a reasonable amount, for example 10%, 20%, etc.  That way you aren’t buying at the top and riding it out, if you wait you’ll be in your tried and true 60/40.

FinancialPlanning,Advised to go 100% equities,throwawayinthe818,"I agree with your Financial Advisor. You have 400k to bridge you to your retirement after which you live off 90k with a paid off house. What exactly are you worried about? The 40% allocation in bonds makes sense if you are going to be using that 40% for COL in the next 5 years. Doesn't sound like you need it. Fixed income has only outperformed equities 1 time in US history in a rolling 10 year period. Meaning the year after and the year before equities > bonds.  So pretty safe bet 10 years from today, you're better off if you were in 100% equities and 0% bonds vs 60/40. Keep in mind as well, you're really at a 600k equity / 800k fixed right now so about 42/58. You're likely never going to need your investment account and you should start legacy planning if you haven't yet. If a life event occurs then you reassess. If it makes you sleep better, keep 10% in fixed income or $100k in HYSA (once you're retired) and invest the rest in equities. One year expenses in savings in retirement is a good idea, even if you spending is less than your retirement income.

That's what I would do for myself and advise my parents to do if they were in your situation. I work in portfolio management for a trust company. I have a graduate taxation degree as well. That being said, most of our clients in your situation are thrown in an investment objective somewhere between 40/60 and 60/40 so you're right around there.  I absolutely do not agree with this, however. New president is trying to push our field staff to encourage our clients to be a bit more aggressive in situations like this, like starting the discussions between 65/35 and 75/25. Keep in mind that a firm is incentivized to be more conservative since the risk of losing clients when equity markets are down 15-20% is greater when losses are greater than the risk of losing clients when markets are up 15-20% and clients are unhappy with their +6%. Our fixed income partner even told us we are too conservative, and he benefits from our clients being in more fixed income. If you feel better being in 60/40, you might as well stay in it.  Or start at 85/15 and as you spend down your 400k, glide it down to a 65/35 with 100k in HYSA (kind of think of your whole portfolio as your total liquid net worth and your target is always 60/40).

FinancialPlanning,Advised to go 100% equities,throwawayinthe818,"I forgot to ask if your pension was inflation adjusted. If so, than I agree with your advisor that you can comfortably spend a bit more.

Essentially, if the cash is in HYSA's and TIPS, it should last you \~4 years at $100k spend. That should take you to the point where you are eligible for your SS+pension. Also in that 4 years, it is possible your \~$1M portfolio could grow a little. With the cash gone at that point, $1M portfolio will obviously handle more than the gap of $10k that exists.

With no heirs, you also have the option of a reverse mortgage. But personally I would save the house as an opportunity to buy into a retirement community if it gets to the point later in your life that you need more assistance and can't handle the home anymore on your own together. Basically if you need more assistance at say 80, you can sell the house and use the money to pay for the retirement community expenses.

It is tough to suggest ""how much more"" you could spend, when I don't know what the stock market will do over the next 3-5 years that you are using your cash/waiting for SS/pension. We could see a recession and the value could be 30% less (would still be comfortable at a about $115k-$120k/yr in that scenario) or it could be 25% more (would be comfortable at $140k). So my suggestion would be that if it brings you happiness, you are find to up your spending \~$15k/yr, now without knowing what the next couple years will hold. Re-evaluate when you start withdrawing SS+pensions. If it does bring you extra happiness, don't spend it.

All those numbers are assuming a 4% SWR, which is probably considered a bit on the conservative for someone retiring at standard retirement ages (I'm calling it standard since you are using cash to bridge the gap). So wouldn't be surprised if your advisor was suggesting a 4.5% SWR at your age/situation/% of income that is guaranteed (SS+pension).",RocktownLeather

FinancialPlanning,Could someone help explain vesting?,umairshariff23,"You somewhat have it right, at least for every 401k I've ever had.  The main online dashboard just shows a single lump sum balance, usually with a ""vested balance"" reported if that's different.  

But in the depths of a 401k account is something along the lines of ""contributions by source"".  Those are separate ""buckets"" that track each dollar as it came in, and there are a bunch of types: employee pre-tax deferral, employee Roth deferral, employer match, employer discretionary contribution (separate from match and can have a different vesting schedule), or employee after-tax contribution (different from Roth and has its own rules / limit).  What you'd see depends on how a particular plan is set up and what the employee has done with their own contributions.

Incoming dollars get allocated to the matching category and purchase shares of the chosen fund(s), which are also kept segregated.  So any increase/decrease in share price or any dividend earnings that get reinvested remain only in the appropriate bucket.  

The vesting percentage only applies to the contents of the employer match (and maybe discretionary) buckets.

So I wasn’t sure if you’re just straight up getting (vesting percentage)*($115 + $85). Or if there is a more complex calculation done on the earnings that is somehow pro rated based on when the employer contributions were made.

If it’s only for a defined time, make sure you know what happens when the time runs out.

Because zero percent is free money, pay only what you have to to keep that sweet deal and load up your HYSA with all the rest.

HYSA? You say $6k “saved up” but you don’t say where, it should be in a HYSA. That’s what’s most flexible. You can get slightly better returns in CDs or T-bills, but for a little more work, and you need the HYSA in any case.",Loko8765

Understand the pre-approval is a figure that does not take into account food, property  tax, utilities, and just living.  The mortgage company is not your friend.  Nor is your realtor.   A house at $220k(nothing down) at best will be $2000/month.  Again, I do not know down payment, property tax and mortgage insurance.  This crap adds up.  So, after house and truck payment you have $500/week to live on.  So, what is your weekly/monthly costs for cell, internet, truck insurance, food?  It is doable but will be tough until the truck is paid.  And do not count on wage increases.

FinancialPlanning,What’s the difference and which is the best way to go,Routine-Bus-854,"High level :

* A planer is about helping you create a financial plan for things like retirement, saving for college a house etc.
* A Financial advisor generally will manage or advice your investment portfolio, and some also offer planning services. Some will continuously manage your investments and charge a fee (a percent of your portfolio), some will charge a flat fee but more of a one time thing they wont actually manage your money.

That is very summarized and sometimes the terms are used interchangeably, even though they are not the same. If you want to go with an advisor who manages your portfolio, I would strongly advise you look for a fee only RIA, RIAs are fiduciaries and are legally required to act in your best interest. Lastly I would talk to multiple and go with the one you feel most comfortable with.

On a personal note unless you have a portfolio in the millions, I think most can be fine managing their own money assuming you are able & willing to put in some time, between low cost index funds and target date funds thats kind of all you really need.",FatHedgehog__

look, a big part of surviving on low wages is learning to shuffle your money around properly.  i always used a credit card for unexpected expenses, but not for the things that i wanted.  you also need to be ferreting money away, especially when you really can't afford it.  time is the biggest factor to growing wealth.  you don't need a gym membership.  put that money into investments and find ways to exercise for free.  cut way back on your groceries by learning to cook.  hell, get a physical labor side gig to stay in shape.  when you want to survive, you have to be willing to sacrifice things in your budget that you might not LIKE sacrificing.  you might need to live in a cheaper part of town.  you might need to leave your comfort zone.

you have to be willing to do what it takes to not just survive, but to start thriving.  there are a lot side gigs around that will more than pay you for the time that you invest in them.  i tutored, edited papers, took physical labor gigs, etc.  you just gotta be willing to work extra hours.  that goes for your main job as well.

i used to complain about not getting anywhere at my job, but then i started volunteering my free time and making myself more available to management.  i stopped worrying about my paycheck and started being more present and accountable during my work day.  i started contributing more than what i was being paid to contribute.  i became an asset to my employer.  that strategy really works.  i bet it works even better today than it did years ago.  you can waste a lot of time complaining, or you can decide that you are going to work for what you want.  that said, you have to be patient.  you've spent a lot of time proving yourself to be only willing enough to do what you are required to do.  you gotta spend some time proving yourself willing to do more than you have to do also.  

i'm the boss these days and i have more money than i ever could have imagined.  10 years ago, i might have made your post.  don't give up.  just work harder.  if your current employer doesn't reward that, you will still have the reward of a fantastic work ethic and you will prosper wherever you choose to go.  self discipline is a reward in and of itself, and is the basis of personal success.",waduhjahlee

FinancialPlanning,How do you afford to live with low wages in the US?,GrantKc,"I don't consider $25/hr to be a particularly low wage all things considered. You are a bit over $50k/yr. To me it feels more like a spending issue because a lot of people are getting by on far less. You are at a point where you have some flexibility/options and need to make a few decisions.

$600/mo surplus is not bad. But if you could swing $1000/mo it would be a big improvement and probably give you some peace of mind. Easily doable either by cutting expenses or finding some more income on the side. I get a few extra grand each year by switching checking accounts for the direct deposit promos. You can get certain tax benefits on retirement contributions too which could flow into an emergency fund.

Gas, electric, and water is high for a one bedroom apartment. Do you leave the A/C on all the time?

$100/mo on body products and laundry is also very expensive. These things typically last me months. Are you buying luxury brands and going through them very fast?

Internet is $30 for me but depends on location. I would be sure that you have the best deal available.

Car insurance seems high but sometimes it just is. However, you can often get a cheaper policy if you get a 12mo term. You can also usually get a sizable discount if you pay in one or two payments.

I could be wrong but most of this budget makes me feel like you would get a lot of benefit searching for better deals and buying things on sale.

Ask yourself if you REALLY need the health insurance. Again, you're spending money you don't have on something that really isn't getting used in most cases. Since you just lost a job, check out the marketplace. You can likely get something far cheaper there.

They eat as cheaply as possible (oftentimes terribly, thinking the $1 menu at McDonalds is real sustenance).

Rent - $600. Common rent in upstate New York in poorer towns is under $1,000 a month. 

Electric and gas (water is included) - Under $100 a month. I have an electric heat pump. I live in a brick 2 story building that was built in 1910, on the second floor on top of a store. They sure don't build these wonderful buildings like they used to. I barely hear traffic along our major state route, and I'm right on the street, and traffic is visibly a bit heavy. 

Public transit - $4 a month (I pay per use)

Groceries - <$200 a month

Phone bill - $8.37 a month

Internet- $30 a month. Our internet provider offers new customers a 2 year sign up deal where you pay that little for 300 mbps speed.

Auto insurance - $1300 for the year which includes my renters insurance. 

Health insurance is taken out of my paycheck before it even hits my bank but it's $55 every 2 weeks.

Gasoline I budget $50 a month but it's been lower than that.

I invest $500 a month in my roth IRA.

Sometimes I go to $15 comedy shows, or get a souvenir magnet from a tourist attraction.

Sometimes my rent is taken twice a month or not in that month at all, it depends when they deposit the check.

I'll get a semi large purchase a couple times a year that is either a money saver (heat pump and guaranteed socks for life), a pleasure (my ebike), a time saver (my robot vacuum and my blender), or a combination of all of these (a bus pass).",JoeAceJR20

FinancialPlanning,How do you afford to live with low wages in the US?,GrantKc,"My own family has recently had to adjust to lower wages. My husband was a coal miner and got injured at work. Not enough to get any settlement money but enough for us to make the decision for him to find a different line of work. Before bonuses he was bringing home close to 2k every week. With an added bonus of around 1k a month. Our income took a severe hit and we’re now netting maybe a little over 1/4th of the previous income. We don’t have a village to help with our three children. So when it comes to working we have to find jobs that would accommodate each others schedules. We can’t afford daycare at this point in time. Our savings have ran out. We have both given up a lot of “extras” for ourselves. But we are trying our hardest to make life seem the same for our kids.

FinancialPlanning,How do you afford to live with low wages in the US?,GrantKc,"Here’s how I did it:
1. Do not ever break your budget. It sucks so bad. You will be bored out of your mind but it hurts so much worse to try and get back on track when you have no savings (especially if an emergency happens right after you decided to spend $100 on a night out—this happened to me. I went out, spent a shit ton, woke up the next morning in the worst blizzard in history, apartment flooded, needed a hotel, sent myself into credit card debt because I had no savings. That $100 from the night before looked pretty regrettable at that point). 
2. Protein shakes. It sounds dumb and protein powder looks expensive but they’re packed with protein which you will need to survive on a light diet.
3. Cut your grocery spending as much as humanly possible. For me, this was a daily walk to the grocery store to buy ONLY the food I’d eat that day. It’s incredibly time consuming but saved me hundreds in expired groceries. My savings definitely improved once I started doing this. 
4. Trader Joe’s frozen meals are your best friend. You can get 1 or 2 solid meals for <$6. Worth it every time if you live close to one (and they’re frozen so they don’t expire so you can load up on these) 
5. Cut your driving as much as possible. I picked one day (Sunday’s) that I’d run to a centralized shopping mall to get a whole ton of errands done in one trip. Saved me so much gas
6. You’re gonna be bored as all hell. Puzzle books helped me a ton (dollar store and ollie’s sells them cheap in the eastern US, idk where you’re located). Lots of netflix. If you can, invest in a used guitar, learning guitar takes a long time and it keeps your brain engaged on something when you’re bored and you can find them cheap on marketplace. 
7. List out everything you need that is not included in your budget (for me this was things like concealer, pots and pans, an area rug, etc). Prioritize them by how necessary they are and then how much they’ll improve your quality of life. Buy them in that order when you have extra funds. Set an extra spending amount every week in your budget (for me that’s $40/week) and amount you’ll save every week (for me that’s $50/week). Implement a rule that you have to save your spending money week by week to afford any of the items on this list. It will alleviate a lot of stress of feeling like you need something that you can’t have by telling yourself “If I’m good with spending, I will have this in two weeks”. 
8. All of this sucks so bad and I hate that we have to do it. My life was pretty shit for the first 8 months this year but I finally have 4 digits saved up in my bank account so I know it works. Good luck :)

Edit:
Adding #9: I was able to pick up a super part time summer job working concerts. The holidays are coming up and retail stores are going to be looking for seasonal employment. I prefer seasonal jobs as a second job because I don’t have to commit long term to working two jobs and exhausting myself. Puts some extra cash in your pocket for a rainy day and if you absolutely hate working 2 jobs, you know there’s an end date and it’ll be over soon

Adding #10 too….STOP DRINKING. Like seriously. I was burning at least $50 a week on alcohol alone PLUS when I’d drink, I usually needed to uber twice (once to get home, once to get back to my car or once to get there and once to get back). Tack on another $40 in uber fees. Then you’re hungover as shit the next day so you have to eat out because no way in hell are you gonna be walking to the grocery store in the morning to do your shopping. Tack on another $50 in take out for the day. Now you’ve spent $140 in one go. If you feel like you want to drink, use your spending money to buy bottles and learn how to make nice cocktails at home. It takes longer, is more entertaining, makes you feel better, you learn something, and you typically can’t (or won’t) drink to the point of a hangover. Worked out a lot better for me

If you take public transit, drop the gym and work out at home, cut internet and cut your power usage by half, you can save between 400 and 500 dollars off of your current budget. If amazon is not a necessary you can drop as well. But I would keep for the prime delivery and prime streaming. Though I only pay 8 dollars for mine.

The other answer is to make more money. Get a side hustle. 

One requires more effort and work, the other requires  sacrifice and compromise. Good luck!

He got his first driver's license about 4 years ago, because that took a while. He has to be absolutely CERTAIN that he knows all there is to know about something before he gives it a try. 

For example, if I say, ""Can you put all of the dog food away for me, please?"" He will come back and ask if the dog TREATS should go in the same area, since they are not dog FOOD. He can get frustrated easily if he can't find something, and you might think that there is some kind of crisis, because he can't find the extra bottle of ketchup when the first one runs out, until you remind him to try the cupboard, then it's like ""Oh yeah! Look mom, there IS another bottle in there!"" Things like that.

I am really proud of him though, because he has come a  REALLY long way from how he started, and I think that he should be ready soon. I am also working on a project that should make things much easier for him, and hopefully others like him.

Another option is - don’t go for SWE, at least not right away. There are plenty of other high-paying technical roles in tech.

I'm not an expert though and my math could be very wrong, interest rates are funky.

If you cant qualify because your monthly debt payments are too high, then....pay off loans.

The pmi will be about .25 to .75, versus 11% on loans...so pmi is preffered.

FinancialPlanning,Got my first high paying job . Where to invest/ prioritize,Naive_Effect,"You are living cheaply right now - I presume with your family. That won't go on too long, so don't budget like it will. That's important.

Don't tell your family and friends how much you make - for sure. When  you grow up poor, you are asked to contribute to things, kinda like GoFundMe, but the family version. You stay in control of that at all times: ""I can give $50 towards your \_\_\_\_\_, but that's it"".  Don't loan anyone in your family money. It's either a donation or don't do it. Be sure that you know how to say, ""No"".

Right now, save as much as you possibly can in just a regular savings account. You probably have an immediate need of a car soon. Even if you finance a $25k used car you will want to have a 20% down payment ($5k) and enough cash reserves that you can make payments on that for 4-6 months. (A $20k loan at 8% for 4 years is $488 monthly - let's call it $500 + 200 ""rent"". You would need $2,800-4,200 in emergency cash + food and car insurance + student loan payments.) Reasonably, you would want \~$10k or more in your savings account before pulling the trigger on your car purchase. Your existing car may not make it that long, but you get the idea here.

Once you have accumulated some cash and have the car situation under control, accelerate your payments on your student loans. They are small and manageable, but get rid of that anchor around your neck as soon as you can. Give them an additional $200 a month until they are paid off.

You will not be able to live with your family for a long time (and you shouldn't), so again... squirrel away cash. You will need it to eventually move out on your own. Your emergency fund will need to go up as well to cover your rent at a new place (don't even think about buying for a few years). After you have formulated a game plan, you should talk to your parents: "" I'm starting to get my feet under me in this new job. I'd like to be able to live here for the next 12 months and continue to pay you $200 a month so that I can save enough to get my own apartment. Is that okay?"" They may want to up the ""rent"" a bit since you are fully employed and that's reasonable.    
Consider the idea - just think it through, don't talk about it out loud until you need to- of continuing to pay your family $200 a month for some period of time after you move out. The issue is that you need to move out, and you may find them subtlety torpedoing your move towards independence, in part because they need the money. If you say, ""As a thank you, I'm going to continue paying $200 a month for a year after I move"" - it may make the transition easier for both of you.

It's fine to start contributing *something* to your 401k from the beginning. But once you are able to stand on your own (say 12 months from now) then begin contributing the max amount that is covered by match. You can worry about other investing once you get past the 12 month mark and are steady on your feet.

The big risk you have right now is that you get out ahead of your skis - and then you get laid off. Avoid going into debt right now - or rushing into getting your own place. Build up a cash cushion, because you have a lot of cash needs in the next 12 months as you head out on your own.",Someonewhoisturning

And you’re investing heavily in their education already when they have public school available, and there is no guarantee they’ll even WANT to go to college (or be mature for college), and now you’ve lost years of growth opportunity.

So really no skin off your butt if you do your budgeting right. Always trying contribute to your 401k to at least get your match so you weren't leaving free money on the table.

FinancialPlanning,How did you stop worrying about money?,Virtual_Ad9722,"I'm not clear where your 30k goal came from but one way to stop fretting is to understand what savings you actually need.

Conventionally you would start by getting out of debt. I assume you've achieved that.

The next step is building up a fully funded emergency fund. This needs to be big enough to deal with reasonably foreseeable emergencies. You need to decide how big that is for you based on your circumstances. Redundancy is typically a big concern so the fund needs to be big enough to cover your basic living costs long enough to find another job, with an adequate safety margin. If you require use of a car, it needs to be big enough to cover any foreseeable repairs, or replace it. It needs to be big enough to deal with unplanned medical expenses for you and anyone you're responsible for. If you own property, it needs to deal with any repairs not covered by insurance. Perhaps that's 30k but it might be more, or less. 

Once you understand how big your EF needs to be for you to be safe, and have that money set aside, you can stop fretting about unplanned emergencies.

The next step is to understand what your financial goals are in terms of the amount needed and when it's needed. This would cover things like vacations, hobbies, replacing a car, being in a position to buy a house, raising a family, having enough saved for retirement. Be saving enough to have the money ready for each goal when you expect to need it. Money being saved towards goals more than five years away could potentially be invested in the stock market as long as you've completed the other steps first. 

When you've got a fully funded emergency fund and know you're saving enough to meet your various financial goals and those savings are in the right place, you're ready to get on with your life. It does no harm to review your status and goals occasionally or when your situation changes but there's no reason to worry about it.",PxD7Qdk9G

For me, the biggest thing, is I will not put a $300k to 500k mortgage over my head. Ever. I also don’t want kids, so I don’t need the extra space.

""Shit, 25k isn't nearly enough, I'm going to wait until I hit 75k and THEN I'll surely feel comfortable!""

Hint: it will always feel like that because that's just how the human mind works - it's never quite enough. I still save and live comfortably, but I've tried to not tie my happiness or stress level to a specific number. Now, it's really just about having the freedom to know that A) I've got enough to get me through a year or two long financial emergency B) don't have to constantly check my bank balance to make sure I can pay bills and C) I really don't ever have to go ""without"" something if I really need it/want it.

FinancialPlanning,How did you stop worrying about money?,Virtual_Ad9722,"As far as I can think of, there are two approaches to stop worrying. You can buy peace of mind, or you can just stop worrying. If you want to buy it, you'll need two things: (1) an equity pool large enough live off AND (2) enough cash flow to sustain your expenses.

The equity pool is what the FIRE movement is all about. You can argue this is enough on its own, but I'd argue not really given the number of posts on that subreddit asking about how people can be sure they don't run out of cash given market fluctuations and uncertain life events. Cash flow is what most people have. Working a job produces cash flow, but it requires effort on your part and carries the risk of losing employment. There other ways to produce cash with less effort (owning rental properties, owning a large dividend portfolio, building a company + hiring people to do your job for you and just collecting the checks, etc.), but they require either a large amount of capital or taking substantial risks.

My approach is to orient my life and do the specific actions that will give me an opportunity to  buy my peace of mind one day, and just stop worrying about the rest since it's out of my control. If you're worried about whether you are doing the right things now, if you're worried about whether you'll ever be able to realistically buy your peace of mind ever ... that's a different question entirely.",Busy-Sheepherder-621

Make a budget. What are your recurring expenses? Can you make them lower? What budget do you want for irregulary expenses? And what is left to save. If you have that overview, make sure you automate it. The day your income arrives, start by sending the money you want to save to a separate account.

FinancialPlanning,Should I aggressively repay mortgage?,Most-Essay-2733,"Not a FP or giving any financial advice, just a guy in a similar position to you (at least based on the info here).

One thing that I don’t often see mentioned is that paying off your mortgage faster isn’t just an “investment” that will save you on interest payments, but also a way to deleverage your assets.

From an investment perspective, paying off your mortgage at the present rate will likely underperform the stock market, to the extent that we are able to make generalizations from past performance, but that doesn’t necessarily make it the right move for you.

You’re saving $100k per year, but $85k is going to the mortgage. When do you have to renew? If your rate goes up aggressively, you might be in a tough position. Though I suspect there’s a lot of discretionary spending that you could cut down on, paying an extra $1.5k/month would put you underwater by your current rate of savings. If you anticipate that making payments will cause hardship in the short-medium term, prepaying may be the better option for you.

Other factors that are going to impact your risk tolerance, eg your finances, age/health, retirement goals, personal comfort with risk, etc, will also affect how much leverage might be appropriate for you.

FinancialPlanning,Backdoor Roth & Traditional IRAs,thebluesayjin,Yes I would roll it back to a 401k if that’s an option. The taxes and commingled pro rata calculation is something you want to avoid if possible.,DaemonTargaryen2024
FinancialPlanning,Backdoor Roth & Traditional IRAs,thebluesayjin,"Rolling your traditional IRA into your current employer's 401(k) can be a viable strategy to facilitate backdoor Roth IRA contributions without incurring taxes on the conversion. By doing this, you essentially eliminate the pro-rata rule issue, making your future backdoor Roth conversions non-taxable.

However, before making a decision, consider the following factors:

Fees and Investment Options: Evaluate the fees and investment options in your current employer's 401(k) plan. Ensure that the plan offers low-cost investments and a diverse range of options to meet your investment needs.
Employer Match: Check if your current employer offers a matching contribution to the 401(k) plan. If there's a match, it could offset the decision's financial impact.
Future Contributions: Consider how the 401(k) plan aligns with your long-term retirement savings goals. Evaluate whether you plan to contribute more to the 401(k) in the future.
Tax Implications: Assess the tax implications of the rollover. Depending on your tax bracket and the amount in the traditional IRA, the rollover might have tax consequences. Consult with a tax advisor to understand the potential tax impact.
Flexibility: Consider the flexibility of the 401(k) plan. Some plans may have restrictions on withdrawals or loans, which could affect your financial flexibility.
State Taxes: Be mindful of state tax implications related to the 401(k) rollover, as state tax laws can vary.
Given the complexity of these decisions and potential tax implications, it's advisable to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional.",yogi2350
FinancialPlanning,Backdoor Roth & Traditional IRAs,thebluesayjin,">Is it worth rolling the IRA into my current employers 401K to make the backdoor Roth non-taxable going forward?

As long as your current 401k does allow a ""reverse rollover"" (some plans are more restrictive than what the IRS allows), then there's not much downside. You'd have fewer options for your investment choices, since the employer gets to set those with a work plan.  But if this 401k offers funds that are mostly equivalent to what you'd pick in an IRA anyway, then that's not a big deal.  

Another factor that could make this less of a good path is any plan fee coming out of your 401k balance.  Many plans will have fees covered by the employer, at least while you're working for them, but not all.  Does your 401k charge the employee a fee based on ""percentage of assets under management""?  If so, the addition of this IRA balance will increase that fee and cause a ""drag"" on your future growth behind a similar investment in an IRA.  If fees are covered by your employer or it's a flat dollar amount regardless of balance, then adding this IRA money won't change anything.

Another limitation with a 401k is that you have much less access to that money before retirement.  You can request a withdrawal from an IRA at any time to get those dollars in your hands (just incurring tax + penalty).  There are very few ways to get money out of a 401k at your current employer prior to reaching the necessary age.  Since you shouldn't be tapping retirement funds early anyway, having that ""lock"" usually isn't a big problem.",sciguyCO

My advice,
- live at home as long as possible, especially if your parents are willing to and it doesn’t compromise your mental health.  Don’t forget to chip in where you can!
- max out 401k, HSA, etc.
- bank any increases, bonuses, etc. as much as possible.  Do not let your lifestyle creep into new money.  Obviously enjoy life, but a Toyota is a better option than a Lexus (as far as living within one’s means).
- don’t forget to enjoy life.  Focus less on “things” and more on experiences.

As far as real estate.  There is so much hype to own real estate.  At your level, ETFs are just fine.  Real estate requires additional liquid assets in case the investment turns sour, repairs, etc.  

I think for you (at your stage), right now is to accumulate funds.  Work on that first $50k then $100k.  At about that range, you’ll likely be making a little more income and having $100k will be a nice cushion you could tap, if need be (major financial emergency).

If you have no emergency fund i'd build one (6 months expense is a good barometer) and then I'd pay off loans.

Once you reach 80% LTV on your house, you can drop the PMI. There are two ways to do this. Either you wait for the market value of your house to rise enough that the LTV reaches 80%, or you pay down the loan to 80%.

Aim for dumping PMI as your first goal, before you worry about paying off the loan in full.

When you pay more than the set monthly payment amount in any month, it will be applied to principal and this will save you interest in the long run by paying off your mortgage balance quicker.

The mechanism of that move may have varying financial / tax impacts.

The simplest way is just to sell off your existing holdings (which may incur taxable gains), transfer the resulting cash to Fidelity, and use those dollars to buy whatever investments you choose in your new account.  

There is sometimes the option to do an ""in kind"" transfer of the shares themselves between accounts, involving no sale.  There's not really an issue for ETFs / single-company stock, but for mutual funds this often requires that the destination brokerage offers those funds.  Or at least be willing to hold them in your account.  Future transactions with those mutual fund shares may incur fees charged by Fidelity (often waived for ""in house"" funds), so unless you're sure you want to hang onto these long-term, it'd probably be cheaper to execute the sale in your Mass Mutual account.

As a parting gift, some brokerages will charge a ""transfer"" or ""closure"" fee when moving your business elsewhere.  Fidelity may be willing to refund this fee, it shouldn't hurt to ask.",sciguyCO
FinancialPlanning,"'Moronic' Monday - Your weekly thread for the questions you've always wanted to ask about personal finances, investing, and growing your personal wealth.",AutoModerator,"Short answer: you can't invest these unless you move them to some other institution.

Long answer: ""IRA"" is basically just a wrapper around some financial account that gives you some shielding from owing taxes.  ""Traditional"" and ""Roth"" are just the two variations of that wrapper, each has different types of shielding.  The options of what you can do with that inner account is limited to what the institution can offer.  Banks and credit unions do not (and I believe by law can not) offer accounts that let you buy investments like stocks, mutual funds, etc. that are more typically talked about around IRAs.  

What you have is essentially a couple of cash savings accounts where you don't owe tax on the earned interest each year.  That might be useful if you were extremely conservative and already well into retirement, but it sounds like that's not your situation.

One, you are 19 and male.  As soon as a car that is called a ""sports car"" is associated with your name you are going to be paying like $500/mo in car insurance.  


Two. As you probably know cars depreciate the most in the first year of ownership.  If you buy a 40k car its going to be worth 30k by the end of that year.  So if you buy a car and then you sell it a year later you are basically lighting a match to $10k not to mention the interest/insurance you had to pay during that time.

Three.  Your income may have been lower before but if you make $1500 a week then it is still low relative to the car you are considering.  Sounds like you make $78k a year and you want to buy a $34k car which is expensive for your salary especially when you take into account the likely atrocious loan and insurance that will come along with it.

What you should do is you should use that new income to put as much into your current car until you are no longer upside down on the loan (I assume you are upside down on the loan) and then sell that car and buy yourself something more reasonable that fits your income and your age and won't absolutely wreck you with insurance costs.

FinancialPlanning,Is a personal loan right for me?,shneids,"A HELOC, personal loans, and 0% credit card offers are options.   

First things first, figure out your budget.    
It sounds like you don't have control over your finances. You don't really know where your income is going, both on a monthly and annual rate. If you take on any debt at this point, even just moving debt, you'll likely run up those credit cards for the same reasons. Once you've figured it out, come back with that info and we can give better advice.  

Why am I against HELOC for this case?   
Until you have control of your finances, you're likely to run the cards back up and put yourself in a worse spot.   
Right now, if you declare bankruptcy or default on the credit cards, it sucks.    
If you get a HELOC, put all this debt on the house and then default, its worse. Far worse. The hit to your credit is higher. It can lead to foreclosure.  

HELOC are great and are very useful for the right situation. If there is a risk of not paying, the repercussions are higher.",ullric
FinancialPlanning,Is a personal loan right for me?,shneids,"Hard to help until you know where every dollar that comes in goes. 40% of take home is usually doable, but with a FT nanny I am assuming spouse is no longer in the picture. 

When you spend some time figuring out where the rest of the 60% goes, you won’t know where you can make cuts. 

I recommend YNAB for budgeting. You are required to assign every dollar a job. You get a real grasp of true expenses.

FinancialPlanning,"I'm 33 years old, earning 10K SGD per month salary in Singapore. Is it sufficient to lead a good life with good savings? Also need your advise on how to plan my finance to reach my retirement goal.",Careless_Bed_289,"So I'm a westerner. Most of the countries in the west encourage savings through specific channels, called tax advantaged accounts. In the US you can save in 401ks, IRAs, 529s, and HSAs to avoid taxes. I recommend finding accounts you can save into that save on taxation. If you can build those accounts it can save a lot in the long term.

I don't know what you have available to you as far as investing goes. But in the West it is common for people to save a lot towards their retirements in mutual funds. This balances risk which could be good for you. 

Some questions:

* Does your country offer money for people once they retire?
* Are you able to access a tax advantaged account in your country that can be used for saving?
* Do your kids have access to proper education (very prominent financial goal)?
* What upkeep goes into the Indian home, while you live in Singapore?
* Are there any favorable tax rules where you live that I have not talked about?
* Does your company offer any kind of retirement savings match (very customary in the west). This could be a pension or 401k?",Tough_Escape8521

You stated goal was to generate income in the future, does that mean you want an income producing asset, like rental income, or that you want to begin working and earn income? If working now I suppose the third option is to take out a loan on the inherited property, use that to help you qualify for and put a significant amount down on a home purchase for you (like 50% down).

Once you get a new job take OT if it’s available, if not, you’ll have a better idea how to manage your time for another part time or a trade.

Me personally I have no college degree and did this and lied my name way to the top of jobs I had no experience in until it was no longer a lie for future resumes. Lied my way into a machine operator and a computer tech just because I have worked on similar jobs and had faith in my learning capabilities.

I’d be networking trying to start some type of business with colleagues. My future one higher paying job I get won’t be my end game. But if you’re satisfied then it’s good. I’d start a trade outside of work or adapt new skills to form some type of business plan. There’s probably already a lot of money to be made off of something you already do as a hobby.

Last night, I was thinking a lot and was watching a number of YouTube videos on how some people work their way to success. It was quiet motivational.

There are tools out there, we just need to know how to use those tools effectively.

From a depressed version of me last night, to a more hopeful person this morning, I wrote down what I’d like to accomplish in 3 months.

I also budget my expenses and see if I could reduce it further.

When we built property A + B we made around $200k profit on each (using a cash out refinance which resulted in the high interest rates).  So technically our last 2 years of income have been around $400k total.  Each of those properties have 3 rental units on them.  All of our properties are in an Opportunity Zone which allows for additional tax benefits.  We have around $250k in savings.  Yes we are able to save around $75k/yr.

The average American has no financial literacy and doesn't begin financial planning until their mid 50s.. You are on a Finnancial Planning subreddit. The average user on this subreddit is going to have above average savings in retirement, don't play dumb. You and everyone here is an individual.

I wasn't saying TVM supports my argument, I was just saying it has to be considered .There is a lot of nuance but I wasn't claiming Roth is better than Traditional in every situation, like yourself. I was just bringing up things that need to be considered which you failed to mention.

There is more to consider than even that, like your nw. Like I'm maxing roth because I plan to have enough to live on in retirement without retirement vehicles. So for me it's legacy planning, but what is your goal for your 401k? Roth offers more flexibility and as your become a lot more affluent, it's difficult to run away from the taxes you will be facing later in life. You mentioned the RMDs..

Financial experts vary on their  recommendations on how much a person should spend on a home (ex. purchase price of a home should be 3x gross salary), but you should read up/research the advice to feel comfortable with those numbers before you make decisions.

Can you get qualified for a home at X amount is different than ""is it a good idea for me to spend this much on a home given my income/financial situation"".  Factors like do you have an emergency fund (3-6 mo expenses?), are you contributing at least to company match in 401k come into play.

Putting 20% down you'll avoid PMI, how long would it take you to save that? 

If/when you start looking for a property I'd recommend going to a mortgage broker vs a mortgage lender (they work w/ multiple lenders). 

You mentioned relocating to PNW, have you spent anytime in these cities? Is it an option to relocate to those areas and rent for a year or 6 months before you start making offers on properties? 

Increasing your credit score obviously wouldn't hurt, if you can do it great but make sure your other factors are in place; emergency fund, saving for a down payment, getting extremely fluent in home ownership costs (mortgage payment, maintenance costs, property tax increases, HOA?), which city is most attractive to you.",Specious_Lee

There are a lot of logistics involved in home buying, especially going to open houses and checking out the homes before you buy. If possible, I would consider living in the area you want for 1-2 months. There could be some neighborhoods won't show up on your radar unless you live there and issues with neighborhoods unless you talk to locals. 
In terms of steps:
1. Use a Home Affordability Calculator (Nerd wallet has a good one) to determine how much home you can afford. And then try to look for one under that price as most homes will have some maintenance or the other that will come up. 
2. Figure out your down payment. 20% is ideal, anything less will stick you with a PMI that doesn't go to your home equity.
3. Find a mortgage broker. I would talk to friends and colleagues about their experiences and find someone you can trust. This person will be a huge deal when you need a mortgage. Mortgage brokers can help you a lot with trying to figure out the best deal. Most realtors have a partnership but for any reason, if you're not connecting, then the process becomes tougher. For example, I love the numbers and wanted more detail than most and found someone who would work for me like that. 
4. Find a real estate agent at the same time. Again, this person needs to be someone you're comfortable with. Don't be afraid to fire a realtor if they pressure you or don't do the work to find you what you need. 

Do the research on the area you want to move to and also research what problem areas in a home to watch out for. In the PNW, I would imagine a good roof, new-ish heating system, drainage in the yard would be important. But talking to locals would be a good idea. Good luck!",maildaily184

I don't have an emergency fund. I have had a 401k with 5% matched for the last 8 years. It will take a very very long time for me to save 20% for a down payment avoiding PMI, probably another 3-5 years. And what will prices / rates look like then? Good advice on the broker vs lender.

I've definitely spent some time in all of the cities I'm considering  but not enough to be super familiar with which areas are 'desirable' vs 'undesirable'. Having watched the ebb and flow of prices vs rates over the last couple years, I had been concentrating more on what's affordable vs what isn't. Overall, rates keep rising and so do prices. This led me to believe that that trend will continue indefinitely, making the time to buy sooner than later. It feels like the longer I wait, the more unattainable it becomes. I realize my perception is probably flawed due to lack of info and there's still a lot of learning I need to do but still... damn.

&#x200B;

Some of the factors I hadn't already considered are making it clear that I will need quite a bit more time before I should buy and I'm bummed.

Home ownership and relocating is the goal, soak up all the knowledge that's out there on financial planning and achieving financial goals, then get into action. Look for Dave Ramsey and The Money Guy Show on youtube (I think they offer a good blend of advice). Sounds like budgeting will be your next step (cut some expenses, know the difference between wants and needs in your daily/monthly expenses, maybe see if you can pick up a side hustle and start saving in ""buckets""). 

Reality is you \*could\* maybe up and buy a house right now, but you'd be stretched thin and susceptible in a bad way if you had a health issue or job loss, so that's not advisable. Do you need 20% down to buy, no you don't, but it'll affect your budget and debt to income, maybe 3.5% down and an FHA loan will work, but you should know those figures cold and how it works in your long term and retirement plans.

As for which parts of town are less desirable, school districts, just look at ratings, rankings of the elementary school districts in those areas. Start tracking those areas for houses that do come up for sale, get familiar with the markets. Maybe meet with a mortgage broker to see what's even possible now, know what happens if rates go up or down a few points.

FinancialPlanning,Credit Union Savings account vs Banks savings account vs IPO,moanapons,"credit unions are, in general as safe as a bank.

IPOs are not saving -- they are gambling.  And there's significant risk of losing all the money you put into an IPO.

Start with mutual funds for investing.  But only with money AFTER you've saved in the credit union (or bank) an emergency fund to cover 6 months of your expenses.  Once you've got a solid foundation between money in banks and money in mutual funds, then you can consider gambling on direct stock ownership.  Investing even in Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google is much more risky than investing through mutual funds.

An IPO is nothing more than a particularly risky way to invest in stock.",micha8st

If I were you, I’d have a bit more in emergency fund, but that’s just personal. Especially as your student loan payments start and a future car payment, it will probably be good to have more cash on-hand. Maybe bump that up to $30k over the next few months because you’ll have gas, insurance, maintenance, etc. to worry about.

Also, with your ESPP, depending on your risk tolerance, consider holding it to get long-term capital gains status so you pay a bit less in taxes. 
Our stock is pretty dependable so I’ve got mine staggered to stay in the account for at least a year after the vesting date before I sell. But, to go along with my earlier point, I have more in my emergency fund to cover about 6 months of expenses just because I’m aware it’s a risk.

How is your 401K? Always prioritize your tax-advantaged accounts. 

Basically, just pick VT or VTI, and go 100% with them every month. Retire in 20 years.",Eltex
FinancialPlanning,Trying to figure out what to do with cash for retirement,Psu88-4life,If you don’t have a Roth? You need to start one asap. You can only put $6500 in every year. You can do it right through fidelity and takes only a few minutes to open when you already have other accounts with them. Roths don’t get taxed on withdrawals. Not even the gains. Also a HYSA could help.,Knichols2176
FinancialPlanning,Trying to figure out what to do with cash for retirement,Psu88-4life,"Since you’re already maxing out your retirement contributions, I’d invest into a few index funds such as VTI each month. do that consistently and you’ll amass a fortune.",future_is_vegan
FinancialPlanning,Trying to figure out what to do with cash for retirement,Psu88-4life,I can’t open  a 401k. My company has a profit sharing account which they contribute a percent of the profits from the year into investment’s and I’m vested 100 percent already. I don’t plan on messing with it.,Psu88-4life
FinancialPlanning,Trying to figure out what to do with cash for retirement,Psu88-4life,Yes I have a Roth through fidelity that’s who handles mine. No I do not have a HYSA,Psu88-4life
FinancialPlanning,I’m really anxious as of late. I’m trying to save for my international move to the uk after my wedding next spring. I keep hitting walls though and need advice.,NefariousLynx,"You have $1,075 left over every month after your normal bills and rent. I’m assuming you’ve already paid for the work on your car so I’ll leave that out. 

On the medical bill, give the doctor’s office a call and try to negotiate a payment plan (say $75 a month). 

Can the wisdom teeth removal wait? Maybe it’s cheaper to get it done in the UK? Maybe you can get on your spouse’s dental insurance and get that covered? If not, try setting up a monthly plan there as well ($100/month or so)

After that, you’ll have $900 left over every month you can put in a HYSA to save for your move to the UK. After 12 months, you’d have saved $10,800 + some interest. 

This is all dependent on you having a decent emergency fund to take care of any urgent expenses you may have from now until your move. 

Good luck!",Successful_Hold_9048
FinancialPlanning,I’m really anxious as of late. I’m trying to save for my international move to the uk after my wedding next spring. I keep hitting walls though and need advice.,NefariousLynx,"First off congrats on the wedding. 

Secondly, it's probably time to start being as frugal as possible. Is there any way to take up a second part time job on the side (Uber, babysitting, petsitting, etc)? Can you cut back on food spending at all? Anything to increase income and reduce spending will help.

Also, the good news is you won't grow anymore wisdom teeth, so it's not like this cost will happen again. You need to keep taking care of yourself and make sure your health is in good standing, because anymore doctor/dentist visits could really hurt.

Most of all, try to be positive.

Good luck!",5MinFin

I keep hitting walls though and need advice.,NefariousLynx,The wisdom teeth can’t wait as I put it off 5 years already and one is impacted now causing me pain. I will look into everything else. I’m someone who hates debt so I pay everything off as fast as possible. I didn’t think of doing this. Thank you,NefariousLynx
FinancialPlanning,I’m really anxious as of late. I’m trying to save for my international move to the uk after my wedding next spring. I keep hitting walls though and need advice.,NefariousLynx,"I already only spend 200$ a month on groceries. My biggest cost is gas for work travel and I work nights so unless I give up my only 2 days off I can’t get another job. I’m already very frugal. I got lucky with rent because the average cost in my hometown is 1200$ per month for 1 bed 1 bath. I have to deal with a roof leak that keeps coming back and my landlord won’t pay a professional to fix it but I’d rather deal with it than a higher rent. I never go out since all my friends are in the uk. 
My parents are covering the wedding costs. I know I could probably pay most off by January however I’m required to get thyroid labs every 6months to keep my thyroid medication. Which means another 600$. Im able to put 1000$ towards bills until they are paid off but I guess more of my stress and anxiety is due to Most being paid off then new charges pop up I have to figure out. I’m already struggling with depression. If I add another job idk how I can mentally deal when I’m already burnout. I work in a therapeutic boarding school which comes with lots of stress already. I had 8000$ in savings years ago and let my ex use it and then he never paid me back so I’m trying to play catch up ever since.",NefariousLynx

I keep hitting walls though and need advice.,NefariousLynx,I would go to another general dentist to see how much it’ll be elsewhere. $1700 is excessive for a single tooth extraction. Unless you’re telling me that’s for 4 teeth than yeah okay that makes more sense,johnny_fives_555

Get a second opinion from a general dentist and not an oral surgeon.",johnny_fives_555
FinancialPlanning,I’m really anxious as of late. I’m trying to save for my international move to the uk after my wedding next spring. I keep hitting walls though and need advice.,NefariousLynx,I’ve been to three dentist now and due to the impacted tooth they won’t let me do non anesthesia. This is the cheapest quote I’ve gotten at a dentist that is in the more affordable range. My insurance through work just sucks. They said they paid 80% or maximum 2000$  depending on which comes first and that I pay 20% but the dentist quoted me 1700$ with insurance. Plus my appointment is tomorrow it’s too late to cancel without a fee,NefariousLynx

FinancialPlanning,Question as a 24 year old about debt,HelloTheirCruleWorld,Thank you! I don’t get match into my 403b until after a year of employment. I just add money into it out of every paycheck to lower taxable income. I’ve thought about stopping the contributions and making an extra payment on the high interest debt. Just not sure if it’s the right move,HelloTheirCruleWorld
FinancialPlanning,Question as a 24 year old about debt,HelloTheirCruleWorld,"Sell the stocks and pay off all the debt today.  The parent plus loans, the student loans, and then the car loan.",fireweinerflyer
FinancialPlanning,Question as a 24 year old about debt,HelloTheirCruleWorld,"The math says to hold. Let compound interest do it’s thing. Not necessarily in a brokerage though. 

But there is a real psychological advantage to being debt free. That physiological aspect is different for each of us. So if you’re a tad risk averse and just hate this debt, pay it! Be happy!!! 

But if you’re a bit more risk tolerant then hold. Maybe double your payments to each of your creditors (even if it means not saving more for a few years) and let that $48k compound.

But when I say “Hold” maybe consider maxing out your Roth, and slowly diminishing your brokerage. Let that compounding interest grow tax free. 

Everything changes if you get a job that offers a 401k with match. But that’s a different topic altogether. 

Congrats on having both an investment account and emergency fund at such a young age!!!",Scottfos72
FinancialPlanning,Question as a 24 year old about debt,HelloTheirCruleWorld,"Straightforward what I would do no extra info

Leave car loan pay minimums
Put some extra money on the 6.6% interest loan
For example: instead of 212 maybe 500
Or just any and all excess income
After it gets under 20k you could probably just write a check from you brokerage

Once the 5% loan comes on pay minimums on that if still paying on the other student loans

If not still paying other off do the same as you did before maybe up the payments to 500 or all your excess.

This time since it’s lower internet and balance maybe right a check at 12-15k instead of around 20k

Looks like you have a high income based on amount in retirement now you shouldn’t have trouble paying these student loans off

Just don’t get into CC debt and you should be good

Also make sure anything you invest is in some sort of index fund or if your company’s stock has low volatility put some in that.",Future_Time2447
FinancialPlanning,Question as a 24 year old about debt,HelloTheirCruleWorld,"Just an fyi, none of what you described is “high interest debt”. When people say that they mean like 20%+ credit card debt.

Your loans are a pain for sure, but if you pay them over a few years it’s fine. Sure it’ll cost you a little bit more. 

But if you start maxing your Roth out every year starting now, you will be thanking me at 60 when it’s crept past a million bucks, withdrawals tax free 😀",Scottfos72
