People piled into all manner of smaller EV names in 2020/2021, looking for ""The Next Tesla"", including Fisker, which had gone bankrupt once already.

NIO is down 87% off the highs. LCID's SPAC ramped to nearly $60 on *rumors* it was going to take that company public. Now it's barely holding $5.

We broke the Soviet Union in the 1980s, mostly with oil but various others were also in play. We are directly going after China's economy now. It should work too and preserve the Western world order. I don't think I would necessarily want to short China, it's just uninvestable, I suppose shorting the FXI could be done on the play that they will eventually move on Taiwan.

Their GDP numbers and retail sales and all that just realized, and they absolutely smashed expectations (trust or don’t trust us up to you). That with the manufacturing and credit expansion, it seems they’re slowdown bottomed Q2

…but it’s still not getting people to buy their stocks.

They set up a fund to buy stocks like they did in the past - and no one cares. They reduced taxes on trading and upped margin requirements to short - and no one cares. They’re upping the amount of foreign ownership allowed - and no one cares.

With all this - foreign flows are showing people are getting the hell out of Chinese stocks (there’s a Bloomberg chart showing foreign fund outflows have been nuts the last few months but I cannot find it right now)

The property issues are dragging on, developer after developer are missing payments. They’re just letting them fail. Which is kind of admirable on one hand, but obviously bad for the market on the other

It’s just not a rosy picture. Taking concrete steps to support their markets, through actual stimulus and not just talks and hand gestures, is very much needed. They just keep saying that they’re listening to people’s concerns People won’t get excited again until actual stimulus happens

On the other hand, some of these stocks are priced like absolute death. Something like JD is trading towards the cash it has on hand.

stocks,China Just Had a Lost Decade,srand42,"People in the past few years have loved backtesting stocks versus bonds, and have touted that American large cap stocks have outperformed corporate bonds, even risk-adjusted, by a pretty significant margin, over any significantly long period of time.

But that's not a guarantee it will always be a case. Commercial law prioritizing who gets paid first or last always leaves shareholders of common stock last in line. 

* If the antitrust movement increases competition in the space, there will be less room to make profits in that environment.
* If the labor movement picks up steam and successfully demands higher wages/compensation, there will be less operational profit. 
* If tax policy increases taxes on corporations at the corporate level, there will be more paid out in taxes, and less profit leftover for the enterprise. 
* If interest rates are high, the cost of borrowing will go up and bondholders will take a bigger chunk of the operational profits, leaving less for the shareholders. 
* If tax policy increases taxes on dividends and capital gains, then the effective rate of return of investing in stocks will be lowered.

Some of these things can last a long time, for decades, so you can see the mechanism by which stocks might see lost decades way more frequently than the broader economy, and why backtesting alone isn't going to lock in a perfect model of future returns.

Rather, Domestic Chinese investors are basically an entire market of WSB users, treating their economy like a giant casino, and not even they type where you can game it by counting cards or pooling your resources with other people when playing craps; they're literally feeding the slot machine tokens in hopes that it'll eventually spit out the jackpot.",mythrilcrafter

stocks,China Just Had a Lost Decade,srand42,"Other risk no one mentioned is that Xi and the party under his leadership (which might be decades) openly argues that tighter controls over the markets and the private sector, government interference and protectionism are the best way forward for China. They know they risk massive sanctions and maybe even a collapse of international trade if they want to control Taiwan (which they do, and Xi is working toward making sure they can do it under his leadership). Who knows how all that turns out, but one thing is certain, and it's that they're preparing for that future, and isolationism and protectionism are their way of mitigating the risk of sanctions.

All that tight control and regulation, government interference, and probably misleading accounting on both corporate and national level, make Chinese stocks a bad investment (at the very least for everyone outside China, but probably even there). Look up why the Chinese stock market underperformed even though there was a lot of growth in the economy.

stocks,Is it stupid to put money in TLT?,NY10,"Don't worry about looking at TLT and where it might head in the next few weeks. What you need to look at is your time horizon and the many months and years ahead.

Say you are in short term treasuries getting 5%. Maybe they go to 6-7%. Unfortunately, those will not be at those rates forever. At some time, the rates will come down if and when there is a recession. Then what do you do? At that time, TLT will have made its crazy move.

The better practice would be start buying TLT every two weeks/every month. Slowly scale in and build up a position. Maybe build it up over 12-16 months where you buy 2K a month. At that time, your yield on TLT will hopefully be 4%+. Now you will be collecting a nice dividend forever and when they cut TLT will appreciate. At that time, you are not panicking and trying to figure out what to do with what you have in short term treasuries. 

Again, you need to scale in slowly, see what is happening and make tactical moves. For example, go look at 2002-2006. TLT traded in a box of 83-90. Eventually, we had the GFC and TLT went crazy. Continued to go crazy after more QE and covid. Now, the returns didn't beat SPY but it was nice getting paid and building an income stream.",arpatel530

stocks,Why is Target doing so bad?,frosti_austi,"Target is going to struggle for the next couples years because they really screwed up on execution in the last few months. The key to retail is about driving customers and basket size (ie the amount they buy). Target is screwing up both.

- Poor checkout process
- Poor inventory management
- Huge capex to stop theft
- That same theft deterrent it hindering sales in core areas

All of the above are making consumers rethink shopping at Target. Especially their core demo of moms and families.

The idea of a “target run” is basically dead. If you can’t get people into your stores, you can’t sell them higher margin products like clothes and cosmetics.

stocks,Why is Target doing so bad?,frosti_austi,"There's a few reasons, imo. The largest is that a lot of spending at Target is discretionary spending, and despite what the propagandists say, the economy is in a very bad spot for many Americans, meaning that discretionary spending is down.

The next point, which kind of feeds into the last, is that people are taking their money where it can go further. Target has always positioned itself as ""Walmart, but a little better, and a little pricier."" Well, now that branding has come home to roost as people are thinking ""Walmart is like Target, but a little shabbier, and a little cheaper"" and deciding to shop there instead (Or Amazon).

Finally, I think that shopping at Target has become an outright hostile experience. Overcrowded stores with one cashier open and a long line at self checkout.

3. Pride backlash is still going strong. If you're going to champion one demographic at the loss of another, make sure that former demographic is greater or at least equal to the latter.

stocks,Why is Target doing so bad?,frosti_austi,"At the most simple level, Target is perceived as being slightly more expensive but not worth the incremental cost.

There's so much more behind that, but that's essentially the big one.

People looking for commodity items and grocery flock elsewhere (Walmart, Costco) and people looking for more specialized goods do the same or use Amazon.

Target has spectacularly poor upper management, and they make this problem even worse, not better.  

They're still dealing with terrible inventory and product mix and product selection problems that keep happening quarter after quarter after quarter.  (Walmart had one inventory management fiasco quarter, but they cleaned it up immediately.)

And worse still, executives resort to deceit and misdirection to deflect blame.

The last few quarters, they've issued deceptive press releases implying their poor performance is due to theft/crime.  These are just press releases, so there's no legal teeth to whether they can be misleading.  

But when you inspect their legally-binding financial filings, you can see theft/crime is very minor compared to much more significant problems that management is responsible for.  

But the splashy and truthy press releases get all the media and public and Wall Street attention.  Crime is bad!  So they've been able to deflect the blame they deserve for incompetent management.  

But the smart money isn't fooled.  That's why Costco and Walmart shares are at all time highs while Target is at a multi-year low.  Note that Costco and Walmart aren't doing deceptive ""blame crime"" PR campaigns either.",MissDiem

I go to Target and I can make my bedroom feel like a million bucks with organic sheets that outdo Boll & Branch at around a third of the price, their brass home decor is safe around kids and doesn’t contain lead like the conventional stuff, and their stores are clean and bright.

And the first part of 2022 during COVID. But the consumer habits changed very fast in 2022 and their profitability took a hit even when sales were still up. Profitability has improved but sales are hurting some now, and student loan payments resuming won’t help that.

I think target is strong long term and picked up a lot of market share in 2020 and 2021. It will just be a little rough until the economy starts doing a little better since target usually makes a lot of its profits off those discretionary items where Walmart leans more into food and essentials.

It’s also super convenient for me since it’s closer to me than drugstores and the mall. I also like that it’s a one stop shop kinda place. Nowadays it’s super congested and understaffed. Things are being locked up and the seasonal products are cheap quality. They also just don’t have as much variety or great deals compared to other stores.

It’s the same selection they had six months ago, it’s not the decor, it’s not the drive up and just get what you want so you’re not browsing, because every store has had that for about 3 years now, and some had that pre-pandemic.  It’s not because their expansion into Canada has gone sour.  Notice how the price collapse can be tied to a very specific incident / time period?

Barely a mention of what’s causing it: Right wing types are boycotting it over social issues, specifically about trans products for children, and one of their designers openly worshipping Satan.  Conservatives make up half the country, and even some liberal leaning types are displeased with trans-friendly clothing for toddlers. 

Same boycott is happening to Bud Light, it’s just harder to stay committed to a boycott against Target because the stores sell so much.

In my anecdotal experience, I think Target is being plagued by a couple of major factors: 1) order pickup has reduced impulse buying that Target is famous for (I worked as a cashier at Target and heard ""I only came in for one thing"" on $100+ checkouts many times); and 2) Target has made it harder to shop because of security.

stocks,Why is Target doing so bad?,frosti_austi,Indeed. I do not think their inventory issues can be understated.,Jniz2006
stocks,Why is Target doing so bad?,frosti_austi,"Few things:


- when you thought target, you thought affluent young white women with Starbucks in hand. that is the #1 impulse buyer category in the fucking world. now, well... you certainly don't think of that. 

- Pandemic Target runs were fun where the girls could go in public and pretend they were grocery shopping or whatever so they didn't feel bad about going out in public and being social. Now they can just go to the bar again.

- These young white women likely had jobs that equated to more real income in 2019 than they do today. Housing has doubled since 2019 and every other cost is up like 30%-100% depending on what it was. the ""real"" inflation numbers are manipulated as fuck. 

- A lot of the young white women who think that running to target and blowing $100+ is fun and totally not a stupid life choice are ... you guessed it... conservative! whether those tuck your dick into this onesie stuff was real or overblown or whatever doesn't matter. media told the story that target was telling kids to get fake tibbies and stuff their dick into tuck pockets andddd they're out. but i'm pretty sure they already were one foot out the door because they are also the same demographic that doesn't really care to coddle or hang around with the shoplifting class.

perfect storm of circumstances and bad management. locking items up and making your store feel like a prison was the dumbest fucking move anyone could have ever made. they should immediately fire every single person who gave that the green light. woulda been better off putting TSA backscatter scanners at the exit for christ sake",turkeydaymasquerade

stocks,Why is Target doing so bad?,frosti_austi,"IMHO, Target is the most vulnerable to losing share to ecommerce.  While Walmart has groceries to get people to become weekly customers, and has products that are difficult  (or even illegal) to ship, like ammunition that will attract a small but loyal customer base, Target has exactly the type of merch that you can get from Amazon and save a trip to the store.

Stores like TJ Maxx/Homegoods seems to be doing better in home furnishings.  There isn't any product that makes 'Target' pop into my head - I think that's common among consumers.

The tuck friendly bathing suit fiasco isn't even on the radar in our household.  I went into Target yesterday to get something for our daughter.  When I told my wife where I had found the product, she said she couldn't remember the last time she shopped in a Target.  I told her I didn't know she was avoiding it... I then remembered, oh, the bathroom thing?  She said yes.  My wife is more moderate than I am in many ways.  And she is squarely in the demographic that Target wants to attract.  So you can say this is out of the minds of their shoppers, but I'm telling you in my own personal experience it is not.  And that's just ONE of their mis-steps in the last handful of years.

That said, I looked at Target revenues since then.  It's really since Q2 2020 or so that they've just fallen flat where Walmart has outpaced them.  Not profit (which would show the ""shrink"" impacts), just pure revenues.

I don't care enough to look at the news/press cycles to see a record of their other moves that punished their shareholders and shoppers since then (it can comfortably be said they are largely more liberal policy decisions), but the bathroom decision only slightly predates a change in their trajectory that has only widened with time.

Target’s stock issues are a real pain in the neck, I haven’t personally experienced quality issues (if anything, in certain categories they’re superior, although their lowest level house brand stuff is “meh,” but their mid tier house brand or exclusives are quite good). 

If they can get stock reliability cleaned up, less clutter in the stores (nothing compared to Walmart storing returned / excess stock in open aisles in bins & shopping carts, but Target still is cluttered these days), and make their promotions work consistently & reliably (i.e. advertising a discount but then it not working in cart check out…as happens often), expand grocery, more dialed “store in store” experiences like Best Buy, and make the check out experience easier (perhaps an app-based, shop as you go model to speed self check out lines up), they’ll be a veritable force again.",jlgoodin78

Honestly if you're going to set an ICE ban as late as 2035 you might as well not even have one. It's not going to do anything to advance the transition to EV's.

But those automakers pushing to get rid of even a 2035 ICE vehicle ban are going to be in for a rude awakening if they think any consumer in their right mind is still going to be buying a brand new ICE vehicle come 2035. With how much battery costs are likely to continue to go down by then (while improving in range/etc.) no one in their right mind will be buying a more expensive ICE vehicle with higher fuel costs than a cheaper EV with cheaper fuel costs in 2035. I highly doubt more than 15% of the new car market will still be ICE vehicles by 2030, and even that 15% number is probably too high, especially in Europe where EV's have been catching on faster than in the US.",ShadowLiberal

Their cash alone could offer what legendary value investor Benjamin Graham called a margin of safety. Moderna had $14.6 billion of cash and investments on its balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, or about 35% of its $40 billion market capitalization.

BioNTech and Moderna are dependent on Covid vaccines for their revenue now, but they have big plans. BioNTech focuses on cancer and infectious diseases. Moderna believes its messenger RNA technology is distinctive and gives it a powerful advantage over traditional drug companies. It is aiming for the launch of 15 new products by 2025, including one combining vaccines for flu, Covid, and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, in a single shot.

stocks,What's going on with Moderna? It's falling so hard,LisaDziuba,"I understand biotech stocks and I am not an insider in any biotech company. 

I am a former pharmacist so I have a doctorate in pharmacy. Aside from my clinical specialties, I have scientific publications as a primary author and I am well researched in biostatistics. This background allows me to know about drugs that may be impactful many years before the public gets excited about them. I can also decipher unreasonable hype in certain drugs.

**Edit: thread is locked. In response to u/princesspool ‘s question, here is my answer:**
I am a long time shareholder of NVO and LLY. I was first introduced to LLY when I saw they were developing Basaglar. I don’t honestly even see the drug nowadays but that’s how I first encountered the company. 

In 2019, I was actively prescribing Victoza to my patients. At that time, we already knew it was a potent drug and we were already fully aware that GLP1’s contributed to weight loss. Fast forward a few more years and Ozempic came into market and it was also an incredible drug. 

For me, these drugs are just part of my arsenal of diabetes drugs I prescribe. The ADA guidelines endorse these drugs as the top choice behind Metformin, and rightfully so. The evidence is there and it is very compelling. 

That said, my opinion might not be what you want. I think the current stock prices are not opportunities. People are overhyping these drugs, going so far as to say they will disrupt McDonalds and Coke stocks. This is a total overreaction by the market. When I saw the dialysis stock drop, I knew it was all just a hype cycle. While Ozempic is efficacious in slowing the progression of renal disease, we have many other drugs that we know of that also do this… ACE/ARBS and my favorite, SGLT2 inhibitors. It is already known science that we have drugs that are renal protective. Regardless, dialysis will continue increasing. Obesity will continue to be a problem. And heart disease will continue increasing. Ozempic is not a magic injection. It is an incredible drug but the market has overhyped it so as such, I believe we will see a re-rating back down some time in the future. I am long NVO and LLY but I do not recommend buying these stocks right now. 

Finally I want to tell you what I am more excited about. AstraZeneca‘s Farxiga is a SGLT2 inhibitor. It is also renal protective, works in patients who have heart failure, has mortality benefit in cardiovascular disease, and is effective in A1C reduction. I am far more excited about Farxiga than Ozempic simply due to the price of the stock at this current point in time.",Atriev

What's lengthy and expensive is clinical testing.  That's normally a many year/decade money pit to proving your drug is save and effective.

We got incredibly lucky with covid 19 since years of pre work was already done with SarsCov1 over a decade ago.  It was put on a shelf though, as the SARS outbreaks did become globally crippling.  

COVID 19 is SarsCov2, so that pre work is the true reason we had instant vaccine candidates.  Many people (fed by clueless media and hype) erroneously credit ""project warp speed"" with somehow making rapid scientific advances.  It did not.  

We got lucky that it was a variant of a puzzle we'd solved already.  Project Warp speed just let them shortcut the final testing, plus it had massive funding to create doses *before* test results were done.  Normally nobody funds doses that could be unsellable.  Warp speed guaranteed payment, that's all.",MissDiem

This means that the government can't get Congress to approve any funding for it because COVID is no longer an issue.

Anyone still afraid of COVID needs to get out under their rock and get some fresh air. No sensible person is buying a vaccine for something that isn't an issue... It's basically a different strand of flu at this point.

The other situation is it's quite obvious that pharma companies ran off like bandits getting these vaccines pushed out like a turnstile. How can anyone justify giving these pharma companies another tens of billions of free $ for a vaccine no one wants? Literally no one wants them...

stocks,What's going on with Moderna? It's falling so hard,LisaDziuba,"Countless studies still show that COVID vaccines still drop the risk of severe COVID cases severely, and even drop the risk of long-COVID.  The only thing that's different is that the COVID vaccines don't protect against the new variants for getting mild COVID cases, with protection starting to drop after 2 months, and more precipitously after 6 months.  It still protects just as well against severe cases (i.e. the kind that was killing healthy people or sending them to the hospital), for a year or longer.  

So what's changed on COVID vaccine recommendations?  Now they recommend them once a year.  Just like flu shots have always been.

It's wild to see a 1k swing in my Amazon position on some days, and nearly always a couple hundred swing on your average day.

So I thought a lot about it and just went in. It's kinda exciting. Ive always been too conservative so this was kind of a growing and learning experience. Ive been able to handle the swings, bit it was a good litmus test for how much risk and volatility I can handle. But here's the thing.... I feel so strongly about the success of Amazon that when it goes down a lot, like during a correction... I pick up a few more! 

So far over my year of holding and buying it it's gone up a lot, so I feel pretty good about this decision. Ive done a few of these one stock moves (Microsoft), and omg my Microsoft has gone up over 350% from when I bought it in 2015!

stocks,What are some good reasons for putting it all in one stock?,lies_are_comforting,">Diversification of your portfolio means ~~lower risk~~ and lower volatility. The opposite must hold true for a portfolio consisting of only one stock, then. Putting all your money in one company means high risk ~~and high volatility~~.

So this logic isn't good. First, ""lower risk"" if you're talking about diversification *is* lower volatility so you're just saying that you have a portfolio with lower volatility and lower volatility. Second, you can absolutely get an individual stock with a lower volatility than a basket of stocks which means, in this case, lower risk.

This by itself is sufficient explanation as to why one may choose to buy an individual company.  

Another really good reason however is dividends and other perks. These are divorced from the market price so who cares if it goes to shit as long as they pay you.",Brokenest

2. You've done your research, know the risks, have a valuation model etc
3. You believe that there is no better risk/reward opportunity anywhere else.

I'm all in on ASTS and oh boy its been a tough ride but they've continued to progress on the technical side. When I first invested, they hadn't even finished building their 2nd prototype satellite and this satellite was the precursor to their constellation. Right now, they're really close to being a going concern which really sucks, they need money but guess what! The tech works! They proved that you connect an ordinary cellphone to a satellite in a way that no one else can. They can provide cellular BROADBAND from space. This is obviously huge but it doesn't mean shit if us equity holders get wiped out from a bankruptcy or some horrible shitshow which is why we pay attention to the risks.

high conviction just means youre really hoping for the best. For all you know, the information you were betting was priced, fraudulent, inflated, or not priced in at all. That being said, IF youre buying on the secondary market, youre already behind the ball in terms of edge.

youre behind for the following reasons:

1) pre ipo investors
2) hedge funds with access to information/whales with access to information.
3) employees with access to information
4) news agencies with access to information.


so youre just hoping that w.e happens, the consumer buys the product/service and the company takes off.

in my time, I think whats common to the majority of companies that failed was hype and hubris.

a good example is blackberry to apple.

I assigned a subjective chance of bankruptcy at 5% and my realistic out was Google buying the company as they almost did years before when Tesla flirted with bankruptcy. 

Based on their ability to increase revenues at 50% YoY for nearly a decade (afaik only blue chips like Amazon have done that) I felt they were still a strong company despite a shaky balance sheet. People literally camped out for days to buy a M3 as they did with the iPhone so I wasn’t too worried about the media narrative of lack of demand. In addition, I took Elons word for it that they were only unprofitable because they were investing to grow the company at max speed versus not investing to show profits to impress Wall Street (similar to what Bezos did with Amazon in the early 2010s when Amazon was unprofitable and heavily shorted).",j__p__

It really depends on whether you want to continue to invest into NFLX or not. If you are just looking for your way out - sure, sell now, depending on how large you position is you might keep a smaller portion, but I would take the profit.

If you want to hold on to your short positions (i.e. you are still bearish), you could use earnings as an opportunity for extra income and sell OTM (or near-the-money, depending how strong your belief is it will tank on earnings) PUTs, again, depending on how large your position is (you need atleast 100 shares to sell 1 PUT to cover it incase it tanks below your strike).

My second favorite is HBO Max and only because of their content. Again, Netflix platform seems very light compared to any other, it just feels good to watch something there vs. any other platform.

They are doing great job with categorization and suggesting content. They were first to do Top 10 Movies/TV and now everyone (slowly) starts to catch up.

I can easily skip forward/backward while watching something on Netflix. HBO used to only have buttons in the player that you had literally to click with your mouse, they have finally after years added keyboard support. Other platforms do 30 sec forward/backward, which is really inconvenient. Again, skipping on other platforms feels heavy, takes too long compared to Netflix.

stocks,Why does everyone complain about growth stocks here?,Glandryth,"It isn't just risk, it is risk vs reward. Having a high beta doesn't necesserily correlate to likelier or higher returns, on any timeframe, long duration or short duration.

Assessing risk can be as simple as looking at the often touted ETF's on here and recognizing that there is only one sector holding the market up. It either ends by other sectors improving (market breadth expanding) or by Tech collapsing before the market rotates or builds a new base. Over the past 5 months every other sector has been one by one destroyed, so the trend isn't rosy. We know from history that concentration risk is always ends badly.

Risk should be analysed by first reviewing fundamentals and classic ratios of earnings, debt, etc. Different businesses have different zones for where these are normal or unhealthy. Technicals can then narrow down risk further, by helping identify trend, momentum, and money flow. Support areas. Going further you can be a quant and watch options pricing to see what everyone is betting on and measure standard deviation.

So if you see complaints of growth stocks its because many of them suck based on everything above. Overpriced fundamentally, exhausted technically, quantitatively they are held up by massive call buying and inverse skew. Socially they are the only remaining (albiet drying) glue of etf's, which everyone pours money into only out of a social norm. Its gamefied. The risk reward absolutely sucks. Just wait and buy them when they are cheap some day. This requires loooong time patience so chill out. Stop with the fucking FOMO.

stocks,Why does everyone complain about growth stocks here?,Glandryth,"Indexing has inherent problems, and it really is irresponsible to simply advise novice investors to go 100% VOO.  One problem is that the S&P 500 is no longer a broadly diversified conservative index - it has become a tech-heavy momentum index, with a quarter of its weight in just the top 5 tech stocks.  The nature of indexing means that a long bull run like we have had since the 2009 bottom, the index will become more and more heavily weighted to the high growth momentum plays.

When a market shock occurs and these momentum plays get pulled back down to reasonable valuations, inexperienced investors are going to see their balances crater  and bail out of the market at exactly the wrong time.

Efficiency and fragility directly correlate in a fundamental way (e.g. if you use the most efficient amount of building materials to make a building that can stand under normal conditions, then it will collapse the first time it experiences conditions worse than normal). People have this illusion that whenever things are working well in the present, the decisions and policies that created the current state of things must have been correct, or at least more correct compared to alternatives where the current state of things is worse.

The problem is that you can always sell stability for efficiency to make things better in the short term.

The rate hikes have been so rapid that they haven't had time to filter their way through the system. There's a huge lag between rate hikes and their impact on corporations. Especially since corporations locked in debt during the pandemic when Fed slammed rates back to 0%. However, the corporate debt wall is hitting in 2024 with trillions in corporate debt maturing the next few years. Roughly 1/3 of all corporate debt will have to be rolled over at much higher rates.

[https://speculatorsanonymous.com/articles/wall-of-corporate-debt-maturing/](https://speculatorsanonymous.com/articles/wall-of-corporate-debt-maturing/)

This won't have as big of an impact on massive profitable corporations but smaller corporations who have become drunk on cheap debt the last 10-15 years will have a harsh reality. Credit is tightening and rates are much higher. This impacts the viability of a lot of these businesses that are unprofitable and have massive leverage ratios. Nearly half of small caps in Russell 2000 are unprofitable and have very high leverage ratios. This has been a snowballing issue since Fed started pumping the economy after the financial crisis. Small companies employ more than half of Americans so job losses in these zombie companies will ultimately affect consumer spending and mega cap earnings.

**How much US corporate debt comes due over the next 3 years?**  
According to S&P Global Ratings Research, $3.1 trillion of U.S. corporate debt will mature over the next three years. This is nearly double the combined profit of all S&P 500 Index members during their most recently completed fiscal years. This significant amount of debt maturing presents a challenge for companies, especially with rising interest rates.  
**Impact of corporate debt repayment on S&P 500 earnings**  
Naturally, the large amount of corporate debt repayment can indeed have an impact on the S&P 500 earnings. Here are some key points to consider:  
Interest Rates: Borrowing costs for S&P 500 companies have risen to a two-decade high. Higher interest rates make debt refinancing more onerous, and new projects could also be reviewed, potentially lowering corporate investments in growth.  
Earnings: Of the 69 basis points of contraction in Return on Equity (ROE) in the first half of the year, nearly half came from higher interest expenses. **Since the global financial crisis, falling interest costs and greater leverage have accounted for nearly one-fifth of an overall 8.8 percentage points increase in the ROE of S&P 500 firms**.  
Debt Maturity: Some $820 billion of US and European non-financial corporate bonds are maturing in the next 12 months. While companies overall are not expected to run up against a truly devastating maturity wall before 2025 onwards, debt-ridden companies are already feeling the pain from higher rates.  
Profitability: The risk of rates now being higher for longer could prevent firms from taking on more leverage, hitting long-term profitability.  
However, it’s important to note that these impacts can vary widely depending on the specific debt circumstances of each company within the S&P 500.",ThreeSupreme

>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says two major long-term issues facing the U.S. economy are sluggish productivity growth and low participation rates in the job market by prime-age workers.

>Powell says that the United States currently lags most major industrial countries in the percentage of workers in prime working ages who are in the labor force. He says one hopeful sign is that this participation rate is finally beginning to move higher, but more needs to be done.

When there's tons of debt across history there are two solutions and it's always the same:

* Hard default - chaos
* Soft default - lots of printing and less painful

We decided to go with soft default.  Inflating debt away.  It's also a one-time reset of paper wealth and wages when there's too much inequality.  Real purchasing power of wealth goes down, wages go up.

No one wants to talk about it but the quiet part is that inflation is a wealth redistribution mechanism.  Overall real disposable income is increasing:

2. And careful using a small time frame like the last 3 months for research. Not only are stocks irrational in the short term, but you’re just chasing gains. NVO for example has already seen a lot of hype and price action thanks to the new weight loss drug.

Before you start investing, it's a good idea to educate yourself. Consider reading books and watching videos about the subject, particularly those that explain the strategies of experienced investors like:

Warren Buffett
Charlie Munger
Peter Lynch
Mohnish Pabrai
Guy Spier
Michael Burry 
And the list goes on...

Learning from these experts can help you improve your investment knowledge. But keep in mind that making money in the stock market is a long-term endeavor and expect to make mistakes along the way. I recommend checking out the Swedish investor's YouTube channel for insights into the books of renowned investors. Be cautious about taking financial advice from YouTube gurus and don't let the fear of missing out on a stock's upward trend paralyze you.

As a couple of tips firstly three months isn't really long enough to understand performance. 

And also ""it's been down lately"" being a reason not to buy assumes that things going down continue to go down and things going up continue to go up.

There's a lot of different strategies you can use to invest. One strategy is simply buying one single stock every paycheck. So I would ask myself - how much I can afford to buy NVO every month with. If you can afford $200 a month, every single month. You can backtest it. Which if did $200 start in NVO and invested $200 a month, every month since 2003 you'd have $960k.   


But you have to ask yourself what you would do when you see negative red returns. Like what would you have done when you went from 36k to 28k  in March 2008 to 27k in Feb 2009. That's nearly a whole year in the red while you'd still have to be buying NVO. You wouldn't be back into the positive until Aug 2009 at 37k. In 2015 you have a high of 244k shrinking down to 144k.

If you want to delve deeper in the world of investing, I can recommend reading The Intelligent Investor by Graham, and One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch. Personally I strongly believe that to invest with the least amount of risk, you need to learn how to value a company (and not just the stock). Aswath Damodaran has an excellent lecture series on valuation on YouTube.

stocks,Stock strategy idea. Help me understand why it's a bad idea?,AKSupplyLife,"This could work! But there are downsides which reduce the likelihood of success:

* Higher taxes on short term gains.
* Should the stock price deviate from this pattern, what will you do? Because if the stock sits within that range or goes down further, you could end up losing the money you gained earlier on this process.
* Conversely, what would you do if the stock price goes above your selling point and never really comes back? This would represent lost gains.
* Do these companies have a dividend? If I understand things correctly, the stock price should dip somewhat after the dividend is paid out, which means that you could lose out on this payment if the timing is off.",Mt_Koltz

&#x200B;

Don't want to mock you, but that's kind of what it amounts to. Issue is that these fluctuations reflect changed expectations of a set of highly informed and specialised market participants. People like you, algorithms checking every travel news article/every online travel site and their (implied) occupancy rate and pricing, veterans who've been following the travel industry for 40 years and math whizzes trying to find elaborate patterns.

The chance they haven't been able to spot an opportunity where a stock randomly fluctuates is very close to 0.

&#x200B;

Another reason against this: you should probably stay away from travel stocks as your personal employment is correlated to the performance of the sector. If we see a continued travel boom everything goes great as you keep your job/get a promotion or better offers elsewhere and build a life.

If the travel industry does badly you might be part of a layoff or see less opportunities for career advancement. Not only will you be set back in your career, your stocks will have tanked as well. If you deviate from index investing, go for stuff that's negatively or badly correlated to travel industry like energy/oil, defense, healthcare, digital disruptors, idk",PartyTimeExcellenthu

You have 5 equity positions. 4 are very volatile growth stocks betting on tomorrow. 1 is a very distressed reit. Dude. Wtf are you doing. 

If you want to be aggressive, just own the best, fastest growing companies. QQQ. Or just lever up with SSO. More return for way less risk than what you hold. 3 of your 5 holdings could be complete bombs. Frankly all 5 could be. That’s not how you build a starter portfolio, save for retirement, or frankly, do anything other than invest money you are comfortable losing. 

You frankly have no business picking stocks. Using an index will save you a ton of time and actually make you money.",apeawake

stocks,Question Regarding Blackberry IPO for IoT Division,Coral_Bones,"When a company does a spinoff they will figure out the value of the spinoff and assign a ratio or multiplier to award to current shareholders. You will then be awarded new shares of the spinoff in addition to the 100 shares of the original company you originally own based on that ratio/multiplier. 

Example:

BB decides the ratio will be 0.5. So for every share of BB that you own, they will award you 0.5 shares of New Company. 

Now you have 2 investments: 100 shares of BB (which are now worth less because they no longer include any value from the company that just got spun off) and 50 shares of NewCo. On the first day of trading, the value of these 2 investments will be roughly the same as the value of the one whole company pre-split.

stocks,Crocs Stock Analysis (CROX),ValueAssets,"It's amazing how many people have no idea how to properly look at CROX debt.  I see comments like ""CROX is a bet on falling rates"".  Yes they took on debt stupidly ($2B) for a costly acquisition in HeyDude.  However this is their debt profile:

* Note $350M maturing 2029
* Note $350M maturing 2031
* Term loan maturing 2029 $1.18B
* Revolver $200M used.

*Debt is absolutely not an issue at all.*  

Of the Revolver there is $550M remaining which they can draw upon ($750M total) with additional extension of $250M if needed (upped to $1B) if they need liquidity.



I will be the first to admit the HeyDude acquisition may have been overpriced.  It is an age old problem.  Execs and employees love acquisitions because they get paid more, everyone gets promoted, and the empire gets bigger.  Cash sent to shareholders just disappears.

But HeyDude wasn't a catastrophe either and they are being overly punished for it.  And their core business is fantastic.  

1. CROX uses proprietary and patented material ""Croslite"" a closed-cell resin material that is light, comfortable, durable and odor resistant. Copycats have tried for a long time to undercut them on price but they fall apart faster and wear down.

2. They rely exclusively on third-party manufacturing in Vietnam and China. It isn't made here and they are very efficient and growing rapidly in Asia. As of 2Q Asia Crocs revenue grew by a whopping 39% YoY. North America isn't bad either, 12.5%.

* Economists are turning optimistic on the U.S. economy. They now think it will skirt a recession, the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates and inflation will continue to ease.

No need to name names but there is a well known poster here that claimed the system would melt down if 10Y touched 4.3% again.

Well now we are well above that at 4.7%, and bank earnings thus far show the system is extremely stable, more than March.  So far bulls are correct in that yields simply rising to below historical averages would not destroy stocks and that both yields / equities can rise together with economic growth.

Banks had a great day today, SCHW in particular up 4.66%.  As a tuned in investor, I personally hate their business model but the truth is probably that the average retail trader or investor does not even notice they are getting killed by swept deposits at all.

I feel like high yield spreads are one of the most important metrics of stability / credit appetite and it's trending down nicely again:

The entire point of owning a business is to deliver cash to the owner, not pump and dump it on others.  The fair value of a company is the PV of all cash it returns to owners over time through dividends.

From 1980 to 2019, 75% of S&P500 returns came from dividends.

Because of our current truly asinine tax structure, buybacks are favored.  But it is bizarre the extent to which investors today trust companies to one day pinky promise to pay dividends.

Arguably the only reason why buybacks are even acceptable as a way to return capital is because they increase owners' future claims on dividends and assets in the event of liquidation or buyout.",absoluteunitVolcker

stocks,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion Monday - Oct 16, 2023",AutoModerator,"A dividend reinvestment is essentially no different than a stock split, more shares each worth less. Its performance from price appreciation will be identical to fewer shares worth more.

You have 10 shares in a company,

in scenario 1 they issue a $0.91 dividend which you reinvest. You now have 11 shares worth $9.09. The stock increases in price by 10 percent, so you now have a position worth $9.09x1.10x11 = $109.89

in scenario 2 they do nothing, you have 10 shares, the stock increases in price by 10%, you now have a position worth $10x1.1x10 = $110.

The ""extra"" you get from dividend reinvestment is exactly equal to what you would have had just from appreciation. You're just taking money from your left hand and putting it in your right hand.

This is theory though. Stocks which issue dividends tend to outperform those that don't, but many people believe this is due to many dividend stocks being exposed to the value factor, which you can get better results if you just track value directly rather than dividends.

That also doesn't mean that a company could issue a dividend or keep the money and it's exactly the same thing. It is important for a company to use it's money in the best way possible for shareholders. Many times that way is dividends, and in that case dividends are better than holding onto the cash.
